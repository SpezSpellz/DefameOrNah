820,if they detect that memory is in working set when it's not supposed to,70
821,they detect by moving memory out of working set when they don't use it and move it back when they use it,104
822,bro wut is that explanation,27
823,and read memory for some reason,31
824,ok,2
825,write memory and all shit,25
826,as even swhx,12

1059,and it worked again,19
1060,I tested it,11
1061,so,2
1062,messagebox works,16
1063,nop,3
1064,is patched?,11
1065,you are  using,14
1066,Maybe,5
1067,I made it a long time ago,25
1068,;-;,3
1069,and it doesnt work anymore,26
1070,thats what im using too,23
1071,I don't know if it works,24
1072,tutorial,8
1073,it was speednextdoor's,22
1074,can u send,10
1075,something,9
1076,do it off a tutorial or sumtninhg,33
1077,did u like,10
1078,very nice,9
1079,I have made a printsploit before,32
1080,i've been trying for 2 days....,31
1081,a tutorial,10
1082,or like,7
1083,perchance,9
1084,do you have a prinstploit,25
1086,was patche,10
1087,the method i was using,22
1088,its cuz,7
1089,i figured why it wasnt working,30
1090,Btw so you got the print address?,33
1091,[Thumbs](,9
1092,I see,5
1093,Or not,6
1094,If you are a skid,17
1095,I don't actually care,21
1096,Don't worry,11
1097,and yeah im a skid,18
1098,i figured it out,16
1099,yeah i know,11
1100,I don't know if you are a skid or not but there isn't any print address in that link,84
1103,which offset here is the one for printing,41
1104,Joy emoji,9
1105,errr,4
1106,i am a skid how do i verify an old cert i chnged my time and it verifies but i cant figure out how to timestamp it to that time it always timestamps the current,160
1107,is there any issues with this,29
1108,Nvm figured it out,18
1109,What methods can I use,22
1110,Even while suspended,20
1111,Everytime I try to modify roblox memory it just crashes,55
1112,Bafelson,8
1113,me when 1 singular google search and an youtube video,53
1114,will do,7
1115,sorry,5
1116,learn then,10
1117,excuses,7
1118,my bad,6
1119,im still on basic C,19
1120,because i dont know shit about memory,37
1121,and that you quite literaly cannot review the code to see what is wrong,71
1122,you have literslly told the world that you lack the ability to fucking code shit that you have to resort to a rock that we tricked into thinking,144
1123,truth nuke,10
1124,i mean you're not wrong,23
1125,bloke youre retarded,20
1126,i give it the pointer for datamodel and it doesnt use it,56
1127,chatgpt is so retarded,22
1128,oh my fucking god,17
1129,smartest roblox exploiter,25
1130,read that ai generated code,27
1131,why,3
1132,im banishing you,16
1133,but i keep getting error Reading DataModel from address: 0x0000000005C2A520\nFailed to read DataModel from address 0x0000000005C2A520. Error: 299,145
1134,i tried using chatgpt to make a program that just reads walkspeed offset,72
1135,can someone help me,19
1136,FOR AN EXPLOIT?,15
1137,WHY?,4
1138,TYPESCRIPT,10
1139,ROBLOX,6
1140,YOU,3
1141,who?,4
1142,how can you enjoy that,22
1143,autistic,8
1144,are you like,12
1145,I use that to write my init script in a nice way.,49
1146,is that roblox-ts,17
1147,what the fuck,13
1148,lol guess what ü§®,16
1149,wouldn't know tho,17
1150,probably some other computers as well,37
1151,it's on my pc,13
1152,where r these roblox source resources,37
1153,where is roblox pdb,19
1154,just let it go already üíî,24
1155,to me it just seems like an excuse to not write a mapper,56
1156,I suppose?,10
1157,isn't that smart tho,20
1158,then you can swhx as you normally would,39
1159,"you rip a decade old leaked cert, then use this shit to sign ur DLL",67
1160,pseudo signed?,14
1161,he uses swhx with pseudo-signed DLLs like all the other skids out there,71
1162,they didn't rewrite the entire engine after the leak,52
1163,rest is trivial,15
1164,I can xref like half the strings in it,38
1165,lawliet thanks for the stuff im gonna test it out,49
1166,"you tried saying a source leak from 9 years ago ""has barely changed""",68
1167,for the resources n shit tho guys,33
1168,anyone with a brain could tell you this lawliet guy is retarded,63
1169,thanks,6
1170,rip,3
1171,you're out of arguments,23
1172,not telling,11
1173,jackie whats ur injection method,32
1174,im done with this conversation,30
1175,oh my god you are retarded,26
1176,years and year sand years old,29
1177,crazy how people still use the 2016 source when reverse engineering because roblox has barely touched the code,110
1178,thats like trying to compare current roblox to the 2016 source leak,67
1179,lmao tell me bro u know the ways üôè,34
1180,"go ask the other guy, apparently I'm incompetent because I value old resources",78
1181,i've never used that function because its wrong and you are retarded if you call that function to do actor library anyways,122
1182,or write some kinda injector to do both at the same time or something,69
1183,i figured out what u mean  but im confused do i gotta run the manual mapper first and then the pool thing or what?,114
1184,using a pdb to come in here and try to flash card people with how actors work,77
1185,maybe you should go make a cheat instead of making these claims,63
1186,"if I have the address to an actor, I can get the thread",55
1187,jesus christ you must be retarded,33
1188,obviously it returns the associated thread,42
1189,is that your argument???,24
1190,"Oh so they changed what getGlobalStateForInstance does? When I pass an actor to that function, it just returns some random global state?",136
1191,thats alot of time for roblox to change how they do shit,56
1192,did you forget that 2022 was 3 years ago?,41
1193,you are using the pdb to try and disprove people who have actually reversed the game,84
1194,"you don't even have a cheat so you wouldn't know which one to ""iterate"" anyways",79
1195,I forget that Roblox cares so much about you,44
1196,"oh right, roblox has two different actor pools and one of them goes unused by the engine but is kept in for exploit developers",126
1197,nigga y'all shut my phone off,29
1198,you wouldn't know that though since you don't even have a cheat,63
1199,t mobile regional manager,25
1200,the actor pool you would be iterating is actually not present in the game anymore,81
1201,no it doesn't lmao,18
1202,the date of the pdb doesn't change the fact that getGlobalStateForInstance quite literally iterates the same actor pool you are iterating,137
1203,makes you look retarded,23
1204,maybe you should grow a brain and go actually reverse since using pdb's to try to prove people who have reversed actors wrong,125
1205,you are just in here to try to tell people they are wrong by using a outdated pdb from what like 2022?,102
1206,"if I wanted to cheat on Roblox, I'd write an executor",53
1207,gotcha,6
1208,"great, don't need to",20
1209,so you don't even use any software?,35
1210,"No, I don't pay for cheats",26
1211,you can't push deleted actors retard,36
1212,spoiler alert: it doesn't,25
1213,your point is that somehow getGlobalStateForInstance stops working if the actor is deleted,90
1214,so egotistical when you are just a consumer,43
1215,that explains why,17
1216,you don't even have a executor?,31
1217,you clearly don't understand the game if you don't understand what im trying to get across,90
1218,I would if I was developing an executor,39
1219,"""proper code"" you do realize that internally, it's *the same code*",66
1220,go run this,11
1221,you got beat by wave in terms of proper code,44
1222,how is wave going to out do you,31
1223,???,3
1224,"good for wave, they also can't differentiate strings from booleans",66
1225,and you are some pro using the worst way of doing actors,56
1226,because they are,16
1227,you need to get your ego checked LOL,36
1228,"yet you have the worst actor lib known to man, even wave stopped using that way of doing actors",95
1229,"why do you call everyone a ""shitsploit developer""",49
1230,>best executor on the market\n>calls it a shitsploit,52
1231,you seriously thought nihon was pasted?,39
1232,"If I had to keep tabs on every shitty paste, I wouldn't have time to write code",79
1233,thats a big cope,16
1234,I don't pay attention to shitsploits,36
1235,if you knew what went down you should know why we don't work for immune anymore,79
1236,i concur,8
1237,"```lua\nfor _, actor in getactors() do\n    if  == ""lol"" then\n        run_on_actor(actor, ""print(getrenv().shared.require)"")\n    end\nend```",142
1238,run this on phantom forces,26
1239,"that guy doesn't even know english, how do you expect him to know a programmig language",87
1240,do you not know how to read?,28
1241,"""when i was""",12
1242,for immune???,13
1243,oh you work for nihon???,24
1244,how do you think when i was working on nihon we had the ability to get actor threads and run on them perfectly,110
1245,you can pass any actor instance and get the related thread,58
1246,because it works,16
1247,how is it wrong,15
1248,"like, you'd have an amazing argument if it wasn't straight up wrong",67
1249,"those who try pushing a deleted actor and instead push some ""instance""",70
1250,crazy how my code works then,28
1251,LOL no you can't,16
1252,I lurk on burners sometimes,27
1253,no I don't have a v3rm acc,26
1254,I can pass deleted actors,25
1255,aren't you that retard that used to browse v3rm religiously?,60
1256,it's the same functionality,27
1257,the function iterates **the same** shit you are iterating,57
1258,brilliant,9
1259,oh does my silly little discord handle determine my intelligence?,65
1260,unable to run any pf script LOL,31
1261,good luck running on deleted actors,35
1262,oh yeah this explains why you are using the worst actor method known to man,75
1263,not what I do,13
1264,so bad,6
1265,wow,3
1266,actor state pool offset hasn't changed for weeks if not months,62
1267,Which coincidentally happens to work 100% of the time for any user-given case,77
1268,associating a script instance with your extraspace is begging for issues,72
1269,you are using the absolute worst way of doing actors,52
1270,I don't need to,15
1271,lmk when you can get every single actor thread from doing that,62
1272,one less offset I need to get,29
1273,I'd rather let Roblox do the iteration for me??,47
1274,its quite literally 1 offset,28
1275,imagine needing to call a func when you could reverse it and rub two braincells together,88
1276,that'd be a GREAT argument if it wasn't for the fact that my code works,71
1277,if you don't reverse actor pools correctly,42
1278,it works,8
1279,this is constantly empty,24
1280,insane how,10
1281,crazy how it returns an actor,29
1282,due to improper reversing and relying on years old pdb,54
1283,if you reversed it you would see the pool you are using is constantly empty,75
1284,I'm using them as the engine intended?,38
1285,you are using actors completely wrong,37
1286,you just need to grow a brain,29
1287,never said it was,17
1288,or what code,12
1289,I'm sorry you can't use IDA,27
1290,you're saying i gotta put my code in the main file but im saying do i need to make the shell code?,98
1291,it's not that difficult,23
1292,finds the actor,15
1293,takes an instance,17
1294,ik i gotta write the injector but im confused about how to use these sources in relation to one another like how to use the manual mapping with pool party or vice versa,168
1295,you don't associate script instances with your thread,53
1296,its wrong,9
1297,nah i get that,14
1298,"look, it's cute y'all skidded the same source, but getGlobalStateForInstance has the exact functionality you're looking for",123
1299,wrong,5
1300,or do you think that maybe *you* need to write the injector code,64
1301,you expect the injector to code itsef?,38
1302,my code from the manual mapping thing like what,47
1303,my code from what bro üò≠ im confused,35
1304,I mean put your code in the  file,33
1305,like replace the shell code or what lmao im confused abt that part my bad,73
1306,wdym tho,8
1307,even if it's just ESP?,22
1308,Lmao,4
1309,you skid both and make a shitsploit,35
1310,if it's just esp,16
1311,can an external be detected by byfron,37
1312,or how i use them with eachother i should say my bad,52
1313,im mostly just confused about how i link the pool party to the manual mapper,76
1315,or the whole file lmao,22
1316,im saying in the  u want me to just replace the shell code ?,60
1317,no i do lool,12
1318,do you not know how to use other people's code,46
1319,like replace it in the file comepletely?,40
1320,easiest way,11
1321,replace  with ur code in the poolparty code,43
1322,also what uh variant ID should i use ?,38
1323,obviously,9
1324,that shit iterates actor states,31
1325,ya it's an old i64 but the concept still applies,48
1326,a while ago,11
1327,they rewrote the actor system,29
1328,actor states does not exist anymore,35
1329,or like u gotta use poolparty a command line thing,50
1330,yo law im just a little confused about this pool party thing can it be used as a library in this code ->,104
1331,wanna tell me what this code does,33
1332,figuring out every other fkn address but getstate and decryptstate,66
1333,wat u want,10
1334,im a noob bro,13
1335,i know,6
1336,"is getstate from searching ""Script Start"" the same as getglobalstateforinstance",79
1337,stop spoof people,17
1338,and what the arguments are,26
1339,then you'd know what getglobalstateforinstance does internally,62
1340,i did my own actor reversal,27
1341,"no one ""fed"" me an actor lib",28
1342,whoever fed you actor lib is incompetent,40
1343,so it's the exact same method except you save yourself 10 useless loc,69
1344,OBVIOUSLY it iterates the global states of the script context,61
1345,what do you think getglobalstateforinstance does internally anyway,66
1346,you think roblox just left in two unused args for funsies?,58
1347,what do you think that 3rd argument is,38
1348,thanks for the pointers tho,27
1349,reip,4
1350,bro skul,8
1351,yo lawliet can i add u you are lowkey smart asf abt this,56
1352,"It's getglobalstateforinstance(globalstates, basescript, actor)",63
1353,show it then,12
1354,are you retarded,16
1355,it doesn't exist,16
1356,like??,6
1357,or you can use the internal function to get the state from the actor?,69
1358,its the proper way,18
1359,that's autistic,15
1360,you wanna iterate trough the actor state pool from scriptcontext instead,72
1361,from there youcan newthread it and execute on it,48
1362,You can pass any actor as the 3rd argument and get that actor's global state,76
1363,not really proper,17
1364,trivial,7
1365,"allocate memory, then whitelist it",34
1366,that ForInstance part is vital to creating a proper actor lib,61
1367,how would u calc that memory ?,30
1368,getGlobalStateForInstance,25
1369,it's not getglobalstate either,30
1370,why do u guys call it getstate instead of getglobalstate,56
1371,IDA can't analyze hyperion for shit,35
1372,no that's binary ninja,22
1373,is this from ida pro,20
1374,not my pic,10
1375,oops,4
1376,is that ida pro,15
1377,replicate that code in your injector and you can whitelist memory,65
1378,underlined are std::set::insert and the pointer to whitelisted pages,68
1379,sorry about stuid questions lol im pretty new,45
1380,sec,3
1381,like insert the name of the dll or that actual bytes that are being injected?,77
1382,"I can, but I'm not going to",27
1383,not writing only reading,24
1384,does byfron block memory reading from externals,47
1385,"in Hyperion, there's an std::set of whitelisted memory pages. So if you want to whitelist your memory, logically you're gonna wanna call std::set::insert and pass your own memory to be whitelisted",196
1386,u can check is encryptions and shuffles wrong ?,47
1387,Because your friend's a retard,30
1388,but its good injecting printsploit,34
1389,anything abt whitelisting? sorry for so many questions lol but u seem knowledgeable,83
1390,and he says dll injector is unstable,36
1391,but my friends have crashing,28
1392,i have whitelist,16
1393,im a little confused about that second step,43
1394,You need to whitelist your DLLs memory if you want to stay injected for >15 seconds,83
1395,are these two right?,20
1396,hm okay,7
1397,combine those two and you'll have a working injector,52
1398,this code does the last step,28
1399,This code does the first two steps,34
1401,or are u saying use the threadpools thing w the manual map injector?,68
1402,if it good injects printsploit,30
1403,does dll injector crash game and be unstable,44
1404,sorry just tryna map out what i gotta do in order so i can properly write stuff lol,83
1405,"so i gotta map  the space out, then use the shellcode injector then make a threadpool?",86
1406,"if you swap that out with Threadpools, you will have a fully working injector",77
1407,why doesn't it work for Roblox? becaause of this,48
1408,^^ this is a manual mapper,26
1409,"you need to allocate memory for your DLL, map it, then use threadpools to spawn it",82
1410,little confused tho it calculates the shell code or it can inject it?,69
1411,testing it,10
1412,yeah fs,7
1413,so u just need to calc code > shellcode then inject ?,53
1414,you're gonna have to write an injector yourself,47
1415,how will u know if chatgpt is right or wrong,44
1416,ah okay,7
1417,shellcode,9
1418,capable of DLL injection right ?,32
1419,you're gonna wanna use direct injection,39
1420,barely,6
1421,"yup, works perfeclty fine for Roblox",36
1422,source code can explain,23
1423,source code cant,16
1424,this still functional ?,23
1425,download the code that's under releases and build it with VS,60
1426,chatgpt can explain,19
1427,what I'm trying to do is learn,30
1428,threadpool API,14
1429,ur better off reading source code than raw dogging it in with chaptgpt,70
1430,OHH,3
1431,+ offset(s) = calculated address,32
1432,eg,2
1433,program *,9
1434,its ur progrma,14
1435,you got anywhere theres some code examples of this possibly?,60
1436,what is base address,20
1437,address is base_address + the offset = the address ( if im not wrong ),70
1438,I'm just trying to learn,24
1439,sorry for being really dumb :(,30
1440,how do I get address,20
1441,uhr,3
1442,you are treating an offset as an absolute address,49
1443,it's off of,11
1444,wym not a valid address,23
1445,Well that isn't a valid address so you wouldn't get anything interesting,72
1446,"would this work? if not, why? ik its chatgpt, I'm trying to learn off it's code",79
1447,it's trivial,12
1448,from there manually map,23
1449,that's some shellcode inj methods,33
1450,doesnt change the fact its easier,33
1451,"threadpools, thread hijacking, IAT hooks",40
1452,writing cheats in python is retard behaviour,44
1453,python is so much easier,24
1454,im not the best c++ dev lol i do mostly python,46
1455,ong its impossible to find anything out lol,43
1456,people gatekeeping so much,26
1457,damn yeah idk,13
1458,dw bro you're not alone,23
1459,im tryna figure out a working injection method,46
1460,"this means the ""anything"" would be interacting with the program __internally__",78
1461,well yeah sorry that was bad wording,36
1462,if you inject anything into a program,37
1463,"""how to get my dll internal""",28
1464,ive seen people have been like hooking the nvidia container or something like that,82
1465,and what read write to use but mostly what injection i should use,65
1466,thats why im tryna figure out how to get my dll internal lol,60
1467,yes i figured that,18
1468,th?,3
1469,# depends if there's an anticheat (or anything that's blocking you from interacting with it with third party program),117
1470,you can do __almost__ anything,30
1471,once you're internal,20
1472,th,2
1473,for code execution possibly too?,32
1474,how do u read write internally?,31
1475,ESP and shit,12
1476,not external like,17
1477,external exec & internal exec,29
1478,ive got this,12
1479,he said,7
1480,why overwrite when I'm reading,30
1481,you need luastate (for almost everything),41
1482,for internal,12
1483,some corescripts' bytecode,26
1484,overwrite,9
1485,you'd need to,13
1486,for externals,13
1487,with the like lua_state and vm,30
1488,or only internals,17
1489,and can externals do any code execution?,40
1490,u know anything about internals?,32
1491,ok can you just tell me what's the first thing I should be researching to figure out walkspeed,94
1492,that you need,13
1493,the read / write functions,26
1494,that driver will,16
1495,and you map driver,18
1496,driver,6
1497,u need ioctl,12
1498,how to read from kernel,23
1499,get kernel,10
1500,nah i get that but is there anywhere you could learn about this?,64
1501,you could,9
1502,I'm guessing you don't because you're just reading,50
1503,do you need to make a driver for extrrnal,41
1504,privet,6
1505,giv,3
1506,but i cant,10
1507,but in bytes,12
1508,i have pro driver,17
1509,im assuming its cuz of byfrons memory protection lmao,53
1510,where do I start with this,26
1512,try to read player's walkspeed first,36
1513,I'm learning C,14
1514,I have basic computing & luau knowledge,39
1515,no üò≠,4
1516,where do I start,16
1517,"yes, only",9
1518,you got any example code?,25
1519,kernel?,7
1520,only solution is kernel,23
1521,external is exe?,16
1522,kernel,6
1523,internal is dll,15
1524,for external,12
1525,there'S no dll,14
1526,uh no,5
1527,whats a working read method tho?,32
1528,exe,3
1529,if you wanna be external theres no,34
1530,arent you external?,19
1531,bruh,4
1532,no.,3
1533,does extreme injector work,26
1534,that reads walkspeed,20
1535,again im very very new,22
1536,make a program,14
1537,atleast idk thats how i assume youd wanna do that,49
1538,make,4
1539,for testing,11
1540,just,4
1541,figure out a read write method and then tie that into ur ESP with like the math and drawing shit u need for an esp lol,118
1542,figure out a way to read them/write them,40
1543,is it updated,13
1544,with those,10
1545,those are the external offsets for the current game,51
1546,``````,6
1547,do you have the offsets for the game?,37
1548,interesting,11
1549,if u wann make a pure esp,25
1550,u could also look at XENOs old source but dont paste it lol,59
1551,they're not a script theyre an external,39
1552,like the external executor,26
1553,from what ive been learning roblox exploits are HIGHLY complex,62
1554,probably just a main app to actually handle everything else like your application to like handle all ur execution functions and injection and other stuff,153
1555,luna?,5
1556,hm,2
1557,like what is the first damn thing I'd be doing,46
1558,its in go so kinda odd but idk,30
1559,id say for an external take some ideas from luna's source code and how they work,80
1560,what is the first script to create,34
1561,bro what I'm tryna ask is,25
1562,like how roblox reads luau and how the memory stack works and how generally everything abt roblox's memory and like idek lmao im new too so im not the best to learn from,169
1563,how,3
1564,where,5
1565,my only goal is to make a esp,29
1566,also figure out like legit how a roblox exploit works,53
1567,I'm going extrrnal,18
1568,look into like methods of memory manipulation (what im doing rn) and figure out if u wanna go external or internal,114
1569,but aside from that like actually making it,43
1570,Lmao im not the best with exploiting but im trying to learn üôè  what id say from what ive been doing is learning the basics of like programming and reverse engineernig and stuff,176
1571,aside from pointers & programming,33
1572,im genuinely lost on where to start,35
1573,im asking yku,13
1574,do you know abt it? or u asking me,34
1575,where the fuck do you even start with an exploit,48
1576,real question is,16
1577,im assuming its because of memory protection from byfron but whats a good way to circumvent it?,95
1578,i have all updated offsets for the current version but any time i try to read/write any of them it wont work lol,112
1579,yo what is a good method for external memory reading/writing right now,70
1580,"Roblox's Luau implementation is C++, and Roblox is written in C++ so to read  the IDA pseudocode, you'll need a basic understanding",131
1581,You're still gonna need to understand C++ though,48
1582,then fuckass c++,16
1583,it seems a lot simpler,22
1584,yeah but C it is,16
1585,I'm messing with you,20
1586,"and even if there was, you'd need to hack in calling conventions for MSVC interop",81
1587,There's no native Holy C compiler for Windows,45
1588,You won't get far,17
1589,I'm gonna learn holy c,22
1590,I changed my mind,17
1591,thanks a lot brodie üôè,21
1592,alright,7
1593,that's painful tho,18
1594,or read the C spec,18
1595,"""how to do X in C""",18
1596,google's your friend,20
1597,I know damn well you didn't pull functions out of your ass,58
1598,did you use documentation,25
1599,no tutorial or anything,23
1600,I learnt C by just writing projects,35
1601,"Well, I can't help you",22
1602,j think that would be cool,26
1603,but I want to make a cheat first thing,38
1604,I wanna go deeper,17
1605,not just to write a cheat,25
1606,"Thing with C/C++ is that they're very simple languages, but they go very deep",77
1607,"If you're learning coding just to write a cheat, you won't get far",66
1608,or anything,11
1609,is there a website,18
1610,but where exactly would one pick it up,38
1611,tysm vro,8
1612,do you think brocode's 4 hour C tutorial should be enough,57
1613,you can pick it up in a day,27
1614,C has like a dozen keywords and a handful of concepts,53
1615,"I don't know, I didn't use a tutorial",37
1616,does brocode have a c tutorial,30
1617,urhrr,5
1618,thank god,9
1619,all you need is C,17
1620,It's bloated,12
1621,I don't know any C++ and I wrote a full Luau executor,53
1622,should I just chug through the 6 hour c++ tutorial video,56
1623,I want to make something decent,31
1624,well yeah but python is slow as shit,36
1625,Requires no C++ knowledge,25
1626,You can write a shitsploit in python,36
1627,Making a cheat and programming are two separate skillsets,57
1628,That doesn't exist,18
1629,well yeah but I wanna learn the bare minimum to making a cheat,62
1630,"Either learn C/C++ fluently then write cheats, or half-ass it the whole way",75
1631,Just the basics won't be enough to write a full cheat,53
1632,I already know luau,19
1633,I don't know where to start,27
1634,like the basics to the point where I can somewhat make a cheat for roblox,73
1635,does anyone know to what chapter in  I'd have to learn to get like the bare minimum basics down,95
1636,regardless very cool,20
1637,the most dogshit video editor,29
1638,filmora,7
1639,want a medal??,14
1640,wow you wrote a python script to bruteforce the most basic offsets,66
1641,Anyways here:,13
1642,Guys did I forget to give offsets?,34
1643,4*,2
1644,(from what i noticed),21
1645,You only need to know 3 vmvalues to get a guess of the rest,59
1646,"I think I noticed a pattern in vmvalues, someone confirm please",63
1647,"take break, come back, finish",29
1648,add assyst,10
1649,it wont open,12
1650,even if i reinstall it,22
1651,bru my roblox is fucked,23
1652,my main acc got banned until 2026,33
1653,my old account in the server somewhere,38
1654,yeah noob,9
1655,in 2024,7
1656,then i stopped,14
1657,well i started making this executor like a year ago,51
1658,since when u started making this,32
1659,i only just came back to making stuff for roblox,48
1660,i dont even have luna source and idk what it is,47
1661,skidded from luna (i saw some logs method but idk),50
1662,ü§ë,1
1663,found a new version to get renderview from logs,47
1664,im new bruh srry,16
1665,how to make an injector the basics,34
1666,this song is good i guess,25
1667,im gotta try to patch it crashing out cuz i patched it,54
1668,finally found it,16
1669,im cracking filmora,19
1670,yup,3
1671,i enjoyed when listening to this in headphones,46
1672,chinky music,12
1673,so fire,7
1674,this song is so fire for me,27
1675,i understand now,16
1676,so getrenderviewfromlog doesnt work anymore,43
1677,u understood,12
1678,ahhhh,5
1679,(i used paint),14
1680,i can prove it to u,19
1681,hm wait noob,12
1682,i use 0x8 then 0x1a8,20
1683,for my own method,17
1684,are u sure fakedatamodel is 0x8?,32
1685,i didnt even do it,18
1686,also some people cried because our staff in roblox skidding community pasted tutorials from (secret ok noob) discord server,123
1687,and pasting,11
1688,i dont have them added cuz im known for skidding and they probably hate it,74
1689,frends,6
1690,btw whats the flexer discord server,35
1691,some flexer owner idk,21
1692,well atleast him,16
1693,"0x108, bytecode and more frends",31
1694,noob = shut up,14
1695,so u are noob,13
1696,okay,4
1697,means ur exec failed,20
1698,and probably gave up since u dont share something new about ur exec,67
1699,im cracking filmora 14,22
1700,never tried to fail,19
1701,i said probably,15
1702,when did i fail,15
1703,u cant be talking when u probably failed making an internal,59
1704,you are a noob,14
1705,make a kernel driver and using that delete deleter2,51
1706,ok enough spoonfeeding,22
1707,ah i see,8
1708,what is dmddeleter,18
1709,thanks mane,11

1712,which offsets,13
1713,good boy,8
1714,sorry sir,9
1715,but u need to say sorry for calling me retarded russian,55
1716,i see have you got them offsets?,32
1717,btw does changing the bytecode for modules still work?,54
1718,lemme see,9
1719,also join another server from partner,37
1720,and look in smart-spoonfeeding channel,38
1721,wheres the server?,18
1722,datamodel method is in my own server,36
1723,i need datamodel and uhh lemme see,34
1724,which,5
1725,external,8
1726,or external,11
1727,wat offsets u need,18
1728,give,4
1729,so pro,6
1730,bro give me every offset noob,29
1731,why are u being pressed,23
1732,can u still do fake data model + real data model?,49
1733,why is this retarded russian still here üíÄ,41
1734,–ª–æ—Ö —É—á–∏ –∞–Ω–≥–ª–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π,18
1735,(maybe i will try to do something else since i have luastate),61
1736,not that bad,12
1737,so like my external xeno is 8 lvl,33
1738,noob i legit pasted 8 level method from luna,44
1739,my game making big lag on task scheduler init,45
1740,(i still need to),17
1741,learn wpf,9
1742,y using winforms,16
1743,tf,2
1744,cant drag anythin to my project,31
1745,any solutions?,14

1749,retard,6
1750,!?,2
1751,wwhat abt me,12
1752,Ye but alot of executors fake it,32
1753,Prob was ngl,12
1754,that were just private,22
1755,with getgc,10
1756,Also im sure there were other externals in the past,51
1757,Same w Russians tbf,19
1758,It's true tbh,13
1759,Every other German I've met r retards,37
1760,First cool German I've seen üíÄ,29
1761,im german,9
1762,üî•,1
1763,I always thought u was Russian ngl,34
1764,its sigma freaky russian,24
1765,He is retarded,14
1766,Retarded Russian üíÄ,18
1767,Dammit i thought i was the first,32
1768,Is it  private?,15
1769,dunno if it has getgc tho,25
1770,Some other russian retard in here made an external,50
1771,Dont think so,13
1772,first external with legit getgc üíÄ,33
1773,cool,4
1774,Managed to get it to work,25
1775,Then make one,13
1776,hello poeple i need a working dll for my executor,49
1777,Im guessing,11
1778,Viewmatrix?,11
1779,you need the dimensions from roblox's visual engine,51
1780,You dont need screen size for that?,35
1781,World to screen,15
1782,why do i even need that,23
1783,1920x1080,9
1784,Your screen dimensions,22
1785,visual engine + dimensions offset?,34
1786,Screen dimensions,17
1787,wdym screen size,16
1788,How do you get screen size?,27
1789,Screenpos?,10
1790,the screenpos gets above their head,35
1791,but when i get far from them,28
1792,i can get the position of them in my screen,43
1793,no i dont think that is the problem,35
1794,Worldtoscreen?,14
1795,and when it is too far it gets above their head,47
1796,"one player is next to me , one is a bit far, and one is too far from me",71
1797,Hello guys. i have a problem where that when i get far from players their head positions and hrp positions change for me. And because of that my esp gets above their head. Who can help me?,188
1798,Until i learn,13
1799,Yes,3
1800,what you're external?,21
1801,Injection?,10
1802,yea I don't think it would be simple just to get injection,58
1803,Little,6
1804,in general,10
1805,know,4
1806,do you,6
1807,no but like,11
1808,I can answer questions if you want to know,42
1809,I dont expect anything,22
1810,you shouldn't expect much if you have no experience lmao,56
1811,programming?,12
1812,basic,5
1813,so you don't know,17
1814,I am learning learncpp,22
1815,No,2
1816,I can print,11
1817,do you have any knowledge in programming,40
1818,thats what i thought 3 hours ago,32
1819,ü§£,1
1820,May the lord help you,21
1821,Thank you,9
1822,first,5
1823,Maybe you should go to learncpp,31
1824,and yet you seem to basically know nothing about coding,55
1825,You want to have the source / tutorials of straight up cheats,61
1826,Ur not learning,15
1827,Yes im trying to learn,22
1828,You clearly dont understand what ur trying to do,48
1829,Look into it urself,19
1830,Yeah im not even gonna bother,29
1831,<a:face_palm:1297888773694029925>,33
1832,Is there document for luau,26
1833,on the platform,15
1834,Thats what you would make scripts or games in,45
1835,the c api for lua,17
1836,Luau?,5
1837,lua c api,9
1838,thats an api,12
1839,Dr pepper said lua c,20
1840,and Luau,8
1841,C++\nC,6
1842,bro..,5
1843,lua c?,6
1844,What language roblox using,26
1845,Yes aimbot,10
1846,im guessing you mean aimbot with aim,36
1847,I wouldnt know of any,21
1848,theres any tutorials on that,28
1849,I dont think,12
1850,I want to do aim,16
1851,to do what,10
1852,Roblox language,15
1853,Is there any documents i can use,32
1854,now just read whatever u want to,32
1855,which it does,13
1856,It was just a test to see if it works without crashing,54
1857,Oh,2
1858,what did you expect,19
1859,its not supposed to return a pointer,36
1860,its a function,14
1861,I am reading your address,25
1862,its most likely just ur code,28
1863,what did u try,14
1864,Well,4
1865,I dont know what to do,22
1866,It does not work now,20
1867,you're gonna have to give it,28
1868,besides the type of arguments,29
1869,There will be 0 difference,26
1870,Because readprocessmemory calls them internally,47
1871,Why not,7
1872,wont make any difference,24
1873,Im going to use ntdll functions,31
1874,Life saver,10
1875,Thank you this works i have my base address,43
1876,hes external,12
1877,GetModuleHandle(nullptr),24
1878,Base address is wrong?,22
1879,CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC,16
1880,That is invalid address,23
1881,So reading works ok,19
1882,That is what i got,18
1883,is that the return,18
1884,20ec834857565540,16
1885,Ok,2
1886,base + 0x2342600,16
1887,reading,7
1888,try raeding,11
1889,also gimme a sec,16
1890,"OpenProcess(PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, false, PID);",44
1891,just do all permissions,23
1892,"OpenProcess(PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, 0, procid);",68
1893,version-dd2acaf7460f42ee,24
1894,Sorry let me find it,20
1895,and show me ur OpenProcess call,31
1896,what roblox version ru on,25
1897,u can always open a handle,26
1898,no nigga,8
1899,Roblox crash,12
1900,Address print,13
1901,I read address,14
1902,It stay,7
1903,Gotta find out if handle is even open after opening it,54
1904,So handle is invalid after read?,32
1905,I print address i read then crash,33
1906,That is why i crash,19
1907,Yes its protected,17
1908,I need to hijack handle?,24
1909,I am using openprocess,22
1910,Adjust privileges etc,21
1911,Do you hijack a handle to roblox?,33
1912,So i ask if i can use ntdll functions to touch roblox memory,60
1913,I try read base address i crash,31
1914,what exactly is the problem?,28
1915,should be right i think,23
1916,7ff7b7090000,12
1917,Sorry im new,12
1918,whats the output,16
1919,It prints same output with module[0],36
1920,when needed,11
1921,and read it / adjust it,23
1922,For stuff like this it can't hurt if you know what you are doing,64
1923,even if its simple,18
1924,but chatgpt mostly writes bad code,34
1925,not exactly wrong,17
1926,why spend time on something chatgpt can do,42
1927,Correct,7
1928,chatgpt ahh naming,18
1929,but works,9
1930,Very bad,8
1932,aint it,7
1933,module[0],9
1934,ye thats what I was about to say,32
1935,u need to get the base from module 0,36
1936,Im thinking that wouldnt work,29
1937,also yeah,9
1938,in CE or something else,23
1939,this would not work,19
1940,did you go to it,16
1941,ever,4
1942,Did you try printing the base,29
1943,Tobias can you help me,22
1944,gl,2
1945,Well i might do a bridge then but i gotta try 1 more thing,58
1946,Nah even when talking to people who know their stuff,52
1947,nobody is trying something else,31
1948,without coroutine lib,21
1949,Thats because 99% is a paste,28
1950,since you cant make newcclosure externally either,49
1951,so I doubt its possible,23
1952,and never seen anything else either,35
1953,never tried anything else so,28
1954,only thing I know you could do is a c bridge,44
1955,maybe somebody else can,23
1956,Well I cant help you,20
1957,well i'm already this far,25
1958,making an internal is basically as easy,39
1959,and I wouldnt say easier,24
1960,Its worse,9
1961,mweh,4
1962,a bridge is like,16
1963,It's just the easiest way apart from c funcs,44
1964,Ye the issue is just calling them from a lua script i can call them from the memory however i can't access them in the lua script,129
1965,Dunno why people still try hard to make externals,49
1966,external is a waste of time,27
1967,anyway,6
1968,"I dunno if this would work, but you could maybe map the funcs into the process",78
1969,i just need a way to push it to the environment,47
1970,i can call it from the _g table when i pushed it,48
1971,Thats what i did to the _g table,32
1972,It sounds like hours of stress and tears,40
1973,of roblox,9
1974,cus to actually push custom funcs they'd need to be within the memory space,75
1975,Theres no other way from what I know,36
1976,but still,9
1977,well it isn't,13
1978,Thats alot of work üíÄ,20
1979,cant just dereference memory,28
1980,because ur external obv,23
1981,not using roblox it's lua c api,31
1982,its all reading and writing,27
1983,you would just need to remake the funcs you need,48
1984,I mean the vanilla lua c api,28
1985,Lol,3
1986,is reading and writing,22
1987,all of the lua c api,20
1988,Doesn't it?,11
1989,This restricts u since you can't use lua c api?,47
1990,also im not too sure if thats possible,38
1991,use a bridge,12
1992,bridge,6
1993,or external c funcs?,20
1994,External execution?,19
1995,I mean external,15
1996,It is what else are u gonna do to push c functions?,51
1997,If it is possible I think it is not worth it,44
1998,I just don't know if this way is possible,41
1999,For everything there is a way,29
2000,That is possible with external?,31
2001,i know luaState + 0x30 should be globalTable,44
2002,is this something that is possible?,35
2003,Anyone here has any experiences with accessing the GlobalTable external and pushing c funcs to it,97
2004,Screenshot?,11
2005,just show me,12
2006,With enumprocessmodules,23
2007,show me the way ur getting the base,35
2008,Roblox not me,13
2009,ur own process or roblox,24
2010,what crashes,12
2011,Actually,8
2012,All of it?,10
2013,show me ur code,15
2014,Still crashing,14
2015,or smth,7
2016,+ 0x1000,8
2017,u can try like,14
2018,if you try to read the base,27
2019,ur getting a access violation,29
2020,yknow,5
2021,Ok one minute,13
2022,atleast try to read like the task scheduler,43
2023,thats not gonna do anything,27
2024,To test if i can read,21
2025,read the base,13
2026,why would you,13
2027,Thats it,8
2028,Im trying to read base,22
2029,What are you trying to read,27
2030,Then ur doing something wrong,29
2031,Roblox crashes if I use that,28
2032,if ur calling it externally,27
2033,theres no difference,20
2034,Just use ReadProcMemory,23
2035,I dont know,11
2036,Why u wanna touch roblox,24
2037,may i perhaps buy one so i can use it no need source:>,54
2038,Can I touch roblox memory with ntdll functions?,47
2039,purge this mf,13

2048,Its not just 1 little thing is i think,38
2049,tdf,3
2050,cause the people who use it downgrade their roblox,50
2051,xeno is patched i think,23
2052,Mention that its for external,29
2053,ill try,7
2054,Just change it to use ur handle,31
2055,It will give you the right one probably,39
2056,Just tell it to get the base address from  from module 0,56
2057,gpt useless for those things,28
2058,Or you can try to ask chatgpt or sum,36
2059,Ima send it tmmrw or tonight,28
2060,i dont think i do,17
2061,yeah i dont know then,21
2062,oh?,3
2063,No u have to get the base from a module,39
2064,something else,14
2065,process id +,12
2066,wouldnt that be like,20
2067,base as in baseadress?,22
2068,Do u have a function to get base?,33
2069,Idk where it is in xeno,23
2070,U just need a base function,27
2071,Like this,9
2072,"inline std::uintptr_t FetchDataModel() const {\n     \n        auto fakeDataModel = read_memory(read_memory->base() + 0x5BF4B58, handle);\n        return read_memory(fakeDataModel + 0x1a8, handle);\n\n}",202
2073,whole thing then,16
2074,oh alright,10
2075,Im on phone thats why,21
2076,Or just send in file,20
2077,or the character its called,27
2078,idk where backtab things are,28
2079,how do i do that,16
2080,Do it in cpp quotes so i can read it properly,45
2081,this or something ? auto fakeDataModel = read_memory->read(read_memory->base() + 0x5BF4B58);\nauto DataModel = mem->read(fakeDataModel + 0x1a8);\n\nreturn fakeDataModel + 0x1a8;,177
2082,how would that look then,24
2083,Just return it,14
2084,Instead of auto Datamodel =,27
2085,Its read_memory u can see it in old func,40
2086,idk how add that,16
2087,in xeno whats the like mem part u put,37
2088,U need to return it ye,22
2089,and i didnt return datamodel so uhh yea,39
2090,or very,7
2091,i think i did it kinda wrong,28
2092,Iwait,5
2093,fsr,3
2094,it just doesnt show it,22
2095,* is after the /,16
2096,tell me what to do and ill do it,32
2098,k,1
2099,Just try with the one u have,28
2100,ion have that one,17
2101,Only modulescriptembedded maybe,31
2102,Those didn‚Äôt change,19
2103,except localplayer n that obv,29
2104,i cant seem to get those,24

2107,U can use the datamodel i send for datamodel,44
2108,nice,4
2109,On xeno,7
2110,This is all the ones u need for execution yes,45
2111,that id need,12
2112,does this have all of them js askin,35
2113,Show me one u need to update,28
2114,i mean,6
2115,like the other ones,19
2116,example,7
2117,This is not a offset,20
2118,What üíÄ,6
2119,"not the ""this"" and those things that idk of",43
2120,Do u have the offsets?,22
2121,then u can plug that into your xeno paste then.,47
2122,ya,2
2123,which means you got datamodel right?,36
2124,i think so,10
2125,well first did you manage to get humanoid?,42
2126,was just asking,15
2127,and your point is?,18
2128,well ofc you'll get walkspeed value,35
2129,the value?,10
2130,i just couldnt find the word i was looking for,46
2131,return i meant,14
2132,and what do you mean get offset back,36
2133,mhm,3
2134,did you get it?,15
2135,bro wdym and,12
2136,and?,4
2137,xd,2
2138,thats what i wanted,19
2139,yeah u get current walkspeed,28
2140,i just couldnt phrase it correct,32
2141,this basically,14
2142,read<f32>(humanoid+walkspeedoffset),35
2143,<float>(humanoid address + walkspeed offset) ?,46
2144,nobody really responded to it,29
2145,it doesnt really say,20
2146,?? read it?,11
2147,a guy said in earlier in chat,29
2148,this is what i meant-humanoidaddr + walkspeed offset - wouldnt this return walksped of 16,89
2149,did you get enough rest,23
2150,im not smoking,14
2151,Bruh what are u smoking????,27
2152,and not the value,17
2153,u just said that yourseld,25
2154,wouldnt i get the offset back,29
2155,??? bro then read it,20
2156,like read it,12
2157,read,4
2158,how would i also get the current walk speed from that,53
2159,yea?,4
2160,"for walkspeed, right",20
2161,using the offset,16
2162,idk how to say,14
2163,isnt it possible to,19
2164,then what bro,13
2165,noo,3
2166,so you want to set your walkspeed to 16?,40
2167,????,4
2168,16 as in 16 walkspeed,21
2169,so I can make sure its correct,30
2170,16,2
2171,u can turn it into,18
2172,with the offset to the walkspeed,32
2173,cuz,3
2174,idk what ur saying,18
2175,how would i get 16 back with the offset so i know the speed im at,65
2176,also,4
2177,why don't ya make a simple walkspeed changer for educational purpose,68
2178,how about u make it urself instead of pasting xeno,50
2179,for educational purpouses to learn üéâ,36
2180,im trying some stuff out with xeno atm,38
2181,how would i update xeno offset and the datamodel offsets too for it to work?,76
2182,and convince Roblox that your pc lag so it's a bit slow,55
2183,suspend  to avoid race condition,32
2184,then convince Roblox that Windows just need more memory,55
2185,EmptyWorkingSet moment,22
2186,we love working set detection,29

2188,i already got fakedatamodelptr with base,40
2189,not base,8
2190,btw i am getting humanoidrootpart name,38

2194,i fixed it dw,13

2207,yet,3

2214,the damn,8

2632,fix the IAT,11
2633,but you can also just,21
2634,so like run from,16
2635,to prevent a crash,18
2636,i make it jump to the original address,38
2637,and when the shellcode runs,27
2638,and unsuspend,13
2639,then i hook run,15
2640,is i start roblox as suspended from the injector,48

2722,how it buffers,14
2723,you do not fucking care,23
2724,what part of abstraction do YOU NOT UNDERSTAND,46
2725,what part of this you don't understand? retard.,47
2726,putting it directly in the string would be faster but it would then take more space,83
2728,lingering what?,15
2729,"Why would I mention ""lingering"" if I (didnt) knew that?",55
2730,u don't? cuz you can send an entire string using a single syscall,65
2731,Okay my nigga,13
2732,üò±,1
2733,have you ever heard of batching?,32
2734,Keep storing ansi seqs inside strings dumb nigga,48
2735,nigga r u stupid,16
2736,Utter retard,12
2737,As for ANY KIND OF TEXT,23
2738,that makes it slow bitch,24
2739,IT LEGIT DOES NOT MATTER,24
2740,if it's fucking unbuffered it's gonna spam syscalls,51
2741,HOW IT WORKS,12
2742,IT DOES NOT MATTER TO YOU,25
2743,Ever heard of an abstraction,28
2744,doesn't matter ur the dumb fuck,31
2745,It doesn't matter nigga,23
2746,If you're storing ANSI SEQUENCES inside a fucking STRING  you're beyond repair,78
2747,"nigga do you even know how these ""stream"" work?",47
2748,the string space bro,20
2749,Send it to the stream when you NEED IT,38
2750,Take what space nigga,21
2751,dumb mother fucker can't even read right,40
2752,I'm saying that using ansi escape sequences before every single characters is gonna make it take up more space.,111
2753,and? that's not the point I'm trying to make,44
2754,You need to separate the sequences and their effects,52
2755,The output doesn't need to be a terminal,40
2756,if you don't print any characters then it won't show up bro,59
2757,"Still, different thing",22
2758,ansi escape characters are characters so you need to print them somehow to make it colored,90
2759,"Plus, its not ""every single character"", ANSI styles linger.",59
2760,Different thing from ANSI,25
2761,"Didn't say that, you call syscall to print text to terminal",59
2762,You don't call any syscalls for ANSI sequences..,48
2763,ill crack for tyou,18
2764,givev the file,14
2765,jz = jnz = exploit for ever,27
2766,its just a jz lol,17
2767,tested by me,12
2768,confirmed working,17
2769,enjoy yall,10
2770,20 or so methods to make ur dll trusted and signed \n,53
2771,which means the size will still affect in the buffer of the buffered writer,75
2772,would have to either put it in the string or use a buffered writer,66
2773,bro then how else ur gonna print it? surely ur not calling a syscall for every single character? You,100
2774,you niggas are brain dead istg,30
2775,who says you have to store the ansi sequences with the actual non-styled text?,78
2776,u learned c++ yet?,18
2777,wsp,3
2778,what i meant is i blocked him bc i dotn wanna argue no more,59
2779,but i know u wont understand,28
2780,if u dont understand what i meant ure dumb as shit ngl,54
2781,nigga be thinking like a lil kid,32
2782,NIGGA STFU U KEEP MEATRIDING FUCKING LADY BOY AND NIGGA HOW MANY BRAINCELLS DO U HAVE TO THINK THAT I WANNA ARGUE ARE U STUPID?,127
2783,bro won't you need like x5 times longer text just to fit in those ansi characters for the gradient?,99
2784,idk what is a key tho,21
2785,wtf bro,7
2786,key please,10
2787,Anyways Ic Injectors on top,27
2788,i wonder why roblox hasn't patch the bypass test sign,53
2789,because of  memory corruption,29
2790,after 20-30 minutes,19
2791,it will bsod you,16
2792,I meant the Remapper,20
2793,btw if you used kde to set dse to 0,35
2794,with the original 5 bytes from the disk dll,43
2795,then replace the 5 bytes that you patched,41
2796,it just loadlibrary the original dll,36
2797,or just switch to driver and use bypass test sign,49
2798,Mind showing me the code?,25
2799,Interesting,11
2800,or just patch winverifytrust at the kernel level with infinityhook,66
2801,what is this for,16
2802,but yeah you also have to unhook winverifytrust so the integrity check doesn't detect you,89
2803,or after,8
2804,i said this before,18
2805,Integritycheck will make u crash after 5-10 s,45
2806,walkspeed static address,24
2807,21D175470C8,11
2808,i just used cheat engine and pointer scanned for it on roblox studio,68
2809,rule 1: no spoonfeeding the pasters,35
2810,my server:,10
2811,yes i think so,14
2812,like you cant change page protections there,43
2813,do they use SEC_NO_CHANGE ON ntdll etc?,39
2814,dm,2
2815,like ntdll  etc,15
2816,i guess they have their reasons,31
2817,like all the other dlls are,27
2818,so youre not doing what i thought you were doing,48
2819,weird they didnt force page protection to rx,44
2820,i see i thought so,18
2821,or bypass the integrity check,29
2822,after,5
2823,so you have to unhook it,24
2824,though they placed integrity checks on it,41
2825,like conventionally,19
2826,"it works, i tested it",21
2827,i dont think that will work,27
2828,yeah if people find out code for remapping its over,51
2829,i have no idea,14
2830,i mean you can if you want no one is preventing you but think of the consequences,81
2831,page,4
2832,wasnt this already on google search,35
2833,well i wanted to give the code for fun because i also got it from some russian but i'm not gonna do that,104
2834,0x108 told me,13
2835,i think there is a easier way,29
2836,so dont spoonfeed,17
2837,but not everyone knows what remap means trolley,47
2838,though all of these methods are detected,40
2839,everyone knows that,19
2840,also swhx still works if you remap,34
2841,was a type issue,16
2842,Interesting Method,18
2843,well last time i tried this was like 1 year ago,47
2844,it was patched,14
2845,i  tried this once,18
2846,thanks nigga,12
2847,rape in the BUTT,16
2848,Stop nigga,10
2849,get,3
2850,<@&1328504708519956541>,23
2851,it looks like a gradient,24
2852,but when you put together multiple characters each with a diff color,68
2853,the color of each character is constant,39
2854,its an illusion,15
2855,85,2
2856,i mean walkspeed adress,23
2857,who has ida pro  crack so i can induldge in some reverse engineeering,69
2858,ur cooked w those roles,23
2859,85 and 6,8
2860,does any one have walkspeed base address and offsets,52
2861,üò± least confused windows user,29
2862,also how the hell do you have gradient text in terminal?,56
2863,there's something wrong with ur code then... my external can scan for handles fine.,83
2864,use this instead of TPDirect:\n,31
2865,process handle is fucked,24
2866,0 handles üî•,11

2913,this guy needs the mega genius role so bad bro,46
2914,lost cause,10
2915,that bypass it specially for cs2,32
2916,there are plenty,16
2917,i saw a ton of open source injector,35
2918,okay bro,8
2919,arent there like already a bypass for vac,41
2920,did you know the sky is blue,28
2921,vacnet has a server side component aswell,41
2922,i thought we were talking about roblox,38
2923,not exactly new,15
2924,ah,2
2925,what is vacnet,14
2926,it's what cs2 uses,18
2927,VAC but new,11
2928,vacnet????,10
2929,nope LOL,8
2930,this message is deserving an ultra genius role,46
2931,do you have any idea how vacnet works,37
2932,sys informer>>>>>,17
2933,yeah but i meant with no patches,32
2934,too much work,13
2935,and then u can hook whatever u want,35
2936,i saw someone using process hacker still not banned,51
2937,patch mem check,15
2938,works,5
2939,but,3
2940,‚ùå,1
2941,u can actually,14
2942,by vacnet,9
2943,instantly detected,18
2944,YOOOOO,6
2945,UM,2
2946,no you can't,12
2947,nope,4
2948,everything works,16
2949,thread hijack\nCreateRemoteThread\nwvt\netc etc etc,51
2950,ill do that then:),18
2951,doesnt it use a KM ac???,24
2952,you can use,11
2953,CS2 is WAYYYYY EASIER,21
2954,depends on the anticheat,24
2955,"not sure, never tried",21
2956,IAT injection should work,25
2957,cs2 will be impossible,22
2958,if you can't reverse engineer to begin with,43
2959,if nah i might switch game first so like i gain a bit of experiece,66
2960,is cheating on roblox easier than cheating on other games like cs2?,67
2961,might try tp injection,22
2962,shadow vmt hooks,16
2963,other than like,15
2964,yeah i can tell,15
2965,you can barely hook anything on roblox,38
2966,wanted to try it,16
2967,saw a thread about it on UC,27
2968,won't get you far,17
2969,trying to hook frequently used funcs as a method of execution,61
2970,i wanted to be different,24
2971,idfk honestly,13
2972,why are you trying to hook iat,30
2973,>,1
2974,and use smt like tp injection,29
2975,should i just give up on trying to use IAT func hooking,55
2976,so wait,7
2977,all of them!!,13
2978,ill just look thru it frfr my dumbass tried like building itüíÄ,61
2979,none,4
2980,whats the best open source exploit that i can paste and claim as my own?,72
2981,skidding is for gay ass niggas,30
2982,dont skid though,16
2983,okayyyy,7
2984,Roblox-Executor-Sources,23
2985,whats the best open source exploit that i can look thru?,56
2986,ngl,3
2987,o,1
2988,easy,4
2989,write a runtime shellcode generator,35
2990,easier said than done,21
2991,dont write shitty shellcode then,32
2992,half the env was faked,22
2993,üò¢,1
2994,internal,8
2995,not at all bro,14
2996,then what do i do?,18
2997,imo the reason its harder is because its harder to debug and if ur shellcode crashes you spend 2x the amount of hours,117
2998,celery was decent,17
2999,^,1
3000,*,1
3001,and complete dogshit,20
3002,for a noob like me should i go  that way?,41
3003,"if u can, go internal.",22
3004,just more aids to develop,25
3005,it is NOT harder,16
3006,celery was hybrid,17
3007,MEM[0x747538583535] the number being the hash for the import,60
3008,yes but its way easier to update,32
3009,is that harder than fully internal?,35
3010,but internal as in shellcode inj,32
3011,like internal + external?,25
3012,"the loader uses alot of lazy imports, and the client uses exceptions to obtain the imports",90
3013,wym?,4
3014,yes if you make it hybrid,25
3015,making external 100 sunc,24
3016,inj,3
3017,is there any way on like,24
3018,fixing this,11
3019,do you have any ideas on,24
3020,theyre mainly used by the CRT,29
3021,"no, theyre just not the ones roblox uses",40
3022,win32u,6
3023,ima try hooking that,20
3024,NtUserFindWindowEx,18
3025,this is so weird,16
3026,imports,7
3027,more,4
3028,but ida shows,13
3029,is run,6
3030,import,6
3031,the only,8
3032,might try this:\n,17
3033,roblox's IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT is invalid,48
3034,im pretty sure,14
3035,I have,6
3036,So are the funcs in their IAT decoys then?,42
3037,Hm,2
3038,i have no idea what you people do wrong to get no xrefs,55
3039,I'll put it into practice later cuz this ass data analytics homework is fucking me,82
3040,btw I think I worked out theory for external getnamecall that can be used with getrawmetatable to make external remote spy,122
3041,have you like ever reverse Roblox? I saw something like that multiple times,75
3042,it's pretty obvious they are getting the procedures manually using something like GetProcAddress or maybe through PEB,117
3043,You're trying to hook IAT?,26
3044,"Does anyone know why most entries in roblox IAT have empty addresses? Is it because they have ""no xrefs"" when viewed in Ida?",124
3045,Cringe,6
3046,based,5
3047,MSVC's limit is 65535,21
3048,GCC has no limit,16
3049,sjadhg[awrgwuoruedfgaoperjh,27
3050,msvc bad,8
3051,"if youre using MSVC, yeah thats your problem",44
3052,string to long errors originate from std::string,48
3053,lol??,5
3054,I've tried this and tested it,29
3055,"With Std string you can infinitely chain multiple together, with const char however you'll overflow",99
3056,"Tell me which one produces the ""string too long"" error",54
3057,Then try to put the same script in an std string,48
3058,Try to put a massive init script in a const char,48
3059,"they both have the same limit of data, none.",44
3060,thats just false lol,20
3061,the 500iq puzzle,16
3062,"a = 10 is a variable but it didnt use it bc of this """"",54
3063,"bc it just gives a variable and the """" is basically showing that it wants to prints the string",94
3064,is this guy genius,18
3065,it prints  a,12
3066,OOOo,4
3067,thats all print,15

3164,slr i jut finished playing bedwars,34
3165,not too difficult but not too much or little,44

3179,ill try later LOL,17
3180,can u make it more than 300 tho,31
3181,like it works by basically modifying how many the mouse register in one click,77
3182,how come,8
3183,cps changer,11
3184,it like modify ur mouse,23
3185,mine isnt auto clicker tho,26
3186,be a crown thing,16
3187,can make u,10

3189,300 way too much,16
3190,yeah I agree,12
3191,so i need to make it like 20 -30,32
3192,and the anti cheat meh always banned me,39

3194,thats a lot,11
3195,what tf,7
3196,no like i was able to click 300x in one click,45
3197,auto clickewr,13
3198,cps modifier aint that like a uhh,33
3199,i modified my mouse it self,27
3200,the only way i actually make my cps modifier work is by  not injecting HAHAHAHAH,80
3201,frfr man,8
3202,u needa get a way to make injector too,38
3203,for roblox that would be wayyyy harder,38
3204,and injecting shitty dll,24
3205,Im makin password manager preferrably writing to a txt to store password n that,79
3206,the only thing i actually be able to create cheating stuff is modifying cps man üò≠,81
3207,Alr thats good,14
3208,could i do like const std::string does that work,48
3209,nnvm,4
3210,meh idk,7
3211,yes but why wouldnt you use std,31
3212,thanks man,10
3213,nice to hear,12
3214,so like if I dont wanna use std i can resort to const char,58
3215,its kinda good,14
3216,and can be manipulated easily,29
3217,thats what im doing im buying a 200 dollors pc frfr,51
3218,aswell,6
3219,std::string can hold a lot more data,36
3220,std::string is part of the stdlib and const char* is always there,65
3221,able,4
3222,like a cheap but,16
3223,oh u should get ur own pc,25
3224,the owner scolded me wgeb i try game hacking,44
3225,whats difference of std::string and char,40
3226,nah bro bc im too dumb LOL,26
3227,And u still dont know?,22
3228,i meant 1 peso,14
3229,5 pesos = 6 mins,16

3236,And knowing windows,19
3237,i been using windows for ages I know most of it now tho I am onto c++ realy,75
3238,true true,9
3239,learning bout windows is the hard part frfr,43
3240,even if i kinda understand c++ now i just realized its useless if u didnt learn about windows man,97
3241,Ima still learn tho,19
3242,I can finally do c++ myself after learning yipee,48
3243,youre on the right path pal,27
3244,lel,3
3245,THIS DUDE IS SIGMA,18
3246,im like at  at,14

3263,farme generation,16
3264,i just took it straight up from a fsr application,49
3265,i didnt even take it from game cheating injector bruh,53

3272,here .,6
3273,thats the idea that i just said,31
3274,first time hearing that,23
3275,what is wvt injector  fir,25
3276,just like setwindowex injector,30
3277,then what if we tricked the win verify trust,44
3278,But it does inject,18
3279,But roblox added detection vectors on win trust\nSo if you modify it the game crashes after 30 seconds or so,108
3280,That's exactly what the wvt injector did,40
3281,how does it get verified by the game what if we tricked the  verify thingy into thinking that our dll is verified,113
3282,But why do u need to call me the n word cuz of that,51
3283,Okay then,9
3284,you should be happy you even got an answer,42
3285,wasnt that hard to say though? was it?,38
3286,Thats what I wanted,19

3301,by reverse engineering ???,26
3302,also hooked,11
3303,it is,5
3304,Same goes for anti virus DLLs,29
3305,You cannot replace it unless you sign your dll and get it verified,66
3306,Yes but it's signed and verified,32
3307,does it inject to roblox?,25
3308,yo   does lossless scalling inject? cause i found  a dll inside its files called  and it works on roblox,104
3309,Updated offsets,15
3310,Can confirm SetThreadContext doesn't work and any use of it will crash the game.\nI tried making a POC external remote spy with SetThreadContext but it will crash after logging 1 output after setthreadcontext,208
3311,its patched?,12
3312,Process Hollowing method,24
3313,/ on what site,14
3314,where do i find those ways,26
3315,There ton ways to inject,24
3316,i guess,7
3317,just try make your own,22
3318,are any of those patched,24

3329,for that matter making them too,31
3330,but idk how to do cuz I aint really been using injector lately,62
3331,worth a shot,12
3332,i said I wonder,15
3333,tool thread hmm,15
3334,but how would I like do that so it doesnt do createthreadremote but another way of shellcode execution,102
3335,Tool thread,11
3336,I wonder if TH is patched,25
3337,ye i just seen it,17
3338,pointers and that,17

3363,"Since I dont know TOO much about these, I know some",51
3364,if you could possibly modify it to work for roblox and like roblox only that would be a pleasure,96
3365,like the method im pretty sure,30
3366,doesnt really seem to work for roblox,37
3367,i tried it before but,21
3368,For mmap I'd take a look at  for reference.,43
3369,u got any public method for map injection thingy,48
3370,i sent u sum stuf,17
3371,check dm,8
3372,"Alright, thanks!",16
3373,"My Time Schedule doesn't allow that, but I'll look what I can do",64
3374,since u seem to be the person to ask,36
3375,0x57 can u teach me about the map injection thing that uses shellcode or such from beginning to end,99
3376,pasted my ass,13
3377,Detected.,9
3378,Pasted.,7
3379,L hater,7
3380,"Looks like simple shellcode injection, simply a joke.",53
3381,i cant tell yall what i use ü§ë,29
3382,man I need a lecture on this lmao,33
3383,how bruh?,9
3384,L,1
3385,took me 1 hour,14
3386,made one,8
3387,i already,9
3388,jokes on you my nigga,21
3389,"Pasters, like you could never make a mmap injector.",51
3390,uh,2
3391,imo you should allocate the dll page with shellcode,51
3392,ffrom shellcode,15
3393,then i run dll main,19
3394,fix it up with shellcode,24
3395,then try to,11
3396,then write the whole dll,24
3397,mem,3
3398,virtual alloc,13
3399,i,1
3400,go more into detail,19
3401,‚úÖ,1
3402,can you,7
3403,and profit,10
3404,map the dll locally and then write it to roblox,47
3405,NO BRO I DIDNT,14
3406,did u not think of that lol,27
3407,asrfkj0i0ÿ∂ÿ´ŸÅ\,13
3408,WAY,3
3409,NO,2
3410,there is,8
3411,makes it easier,15
3412,"resolve import table, reloc the image outside of the shellcode",62
3413,or just,7
3414,aea,3
3415,Resolve imports then relocs then fix seh thumbs_up,50
3416,"Bro said ""im not pasting it"" then you proceeded to not know what the fuck any of the terms the other guy said meant",115
3417,And you're gonna commit suicide,31
3418,And you're gonna look back at this,34
3419,One day you are gonna get smarter,33
3420,Holy shit,9
3421,also whats reflective injector heard of it but idk whats it,59
3422,just as u said shell injector,29
3423,so is it?,9
3424,i wanna look into that is why,29
3425,"shellcode -> resolve imports, call dllmain, etc..",49
3426,is this an ok one for that  i found it idk if it would work tho,63
3427,execute shellcode,17
3428,write sections,14
3429,write header,12
3430,by achieving shellcode execution ..,35
3431,anyway how would i even start that off,38
3432,its because the mapper you're trying to paste is using createremotethread for shellcode execution,97
3433,except that,11
3434,any other methods that work still,33
3435,but I can't seem to get it to work tho,38
3436,ive tried manual map before yk,30
3437,whitelisting your module,24
3438,so manual map is good then,26
3439,that is literally what patching winverifytrust was for,54
3440,to patch,8
3441,you needed,10
3442,chillax,7
3443,it not working,14
3444,Using an ic?? skul,18
3445,and whats ur problem with loadlibrary tho btw,45
3446,speaking to the system??,24
3447,black magic?,12
3448,how are you gonna execute dllmain,33
3449,nigga what,10
3450,isnt shellcode like really detected,35
3451,fuck shellcode,14
3452,write a manual mapper,21
3453,achieve shellcode execution,27
3454,I aint want to use that anyway,30
3455,obv,3
3456,setwindowshookex,16
3457,not using fucking,17
3458,to make injection work,22
3459,ok then whats ur idea,21
3460,trying to inject from km is completely useless,46
3461,yeah no idea,12
3462,is what i would do,18
3463,at that point i would just give up lmao delete the whole thing,62
3464,Que?,4
3465,u aint telling me nothin aswell,31
3466,I'm going insane:,17
3467,slash a way to still do it,26
3468,for injection,13
3469,theres gonna be a bypass anyway,31
3470,yk,2
3471,to winverify,12
3472,kernel mode injector has no relations,37
3473,;,1
3474,not what i fucking said but ok,30
3475,kernel mode injection,21
3476,kernel injector? really?,24
3477,kernel one,10
3478,such as,7
3479,to bypass,9
3480,there are still ways,20

3485,u asked me,10
3486,omg,3
3487,i didnt say i wanna use winverify,33
3488,to try to stop internal injection but,37
3489,what do you think patching winverifypatch is for,48
3490,i aint do nothin,16
3491,bruh im askin for injection methods wtf,39
3492,this server is so fucked,24
3493,i can't bro,11
3494,whats new way of getting those and doin that cuz of,51
3495,cuz as yk winverify got patch,29
3496,is loadlibrary injection good for roblox,40
3497,"no work now, Roblox was updated and it was for another version",62

3575,make your own executor its not hard,35

3796,And 2021,8
3797,Yeah I have that too,20
3798,not on github,13
3799,there a PDB 2018 roblox studio,30
3800,And source code,15
3801,Right which you can fire up yourself and reverse a client of which you have a pdb for,85
3802,"Great, now i have a lot of luavm clones",39
3803,"Learn exploit development, reverse engineering and then once you have a foundation level understanding you can fire up your own luau vm and that'll give you insight on what and why",180
3804,"Yes, i do. But i don't know which functions to use from roblox and luau. How would i figure that out, i have no experience with roblox exploiting and exploit development, just general development",195
3805,And you can fire it up yourself,31
3806,ye ive heard about,18
3807,You realise that luau is open sourced right,43
3808,Well it depends on how well versed you are on reversing.. it's alot easier if you have a hypervisor if that's what you mean,123
3809,I don't need anyone to walk me trough how to write a hello world program line by line or some shit. I just want a technical explenation on why certain stuff is done like it is,175
3810,and would you need drivers or such,34
3811,but how hard is it?,19
3812,Of course it's possible,23
3813,0day is it even possible to run roblox in a virtual machine anymore anyways,75

3816,"I know C++ pretty ok, lua a little and C is just C++ without polymorphism",73
3817,Still relevant,14
3818,taapr is way outdated,21

4786,brings me to wron,17
4787,for me,6
4788,ye i cant work it out tho,25
4789,uniq can u pls show how to get shuffle 7 and all else from ur dump,66
4790,i mean how im supposed to find what i need,42
4791,wtfg,4
4792,what i need,11
4793,now i can use that dump to fucking compare what i need to find um,65
4794,whitelisted 8),14
4795,may i,5
4796,whats the api,13
4797,where are they,14
4798,fym check again,15
4799,just check again,16
4800,don't ask me üò≠,14
4801,they're wrong,13
4802,but atm the only problem is that I need to be online to run it and upload new dumps,83
4803,every live update,17
4804,you would feel like reversing roblox in old days,48
4805,a new on,8
4806,so will be every update or?,27
4807,w it,4
4808,if i open ur dump,17
4809,then i can get shuffle and encs?,32
4810,so if i open in ida,19
4811,+ there are many pros like decrypted strings at runtime and so on,65
4812,this mean that even with new hyperion it will survive,53
4813,I don't my decryptor is based runtime,37
4814,with ur dump?,13
4815,but how would u get encs,24
4816,I feel like there is nothing wrong to know what is running in your machine,74
4817,but rather a reversing purpose resources that is up to the end user how to use,78
4818,it won't I'm not selling cheats,31
4819,"and to get encs, how",20
4820,is it same process with his roblox dumps,40
4821,"also,",5
4822,or a dump,9
4823,then where would i get shuffles?,32
4824,his server encounters a problem like shutting down or something,63
4825,but what if,11
4826,There's no rush just learn as you go along,42
4827,And that's just the dumping logic your dumper won't be as good as uniq's,72
4828,yep rely on my dumps,20
4829,"Yes üòÇ but it's also compiled with a PE, IAT, EAT & it has trap pages. Only certain pages can be read otherwise an exception will be flagged so you need to query each page before reading and adding to the buffer",210
4830,and that,8
4831,Like i know the code is compiled,32
4832,a bit and a bit not,19
4833,Correct but do you know anything about how an application is built,66
4834,The dump is already in there,28
4835,well it seems better to get them myself than relying on a server to give me shuffles it kinda seems for me,106
4836,Use uniquas dumps he's just started a service and it's free right now,69
4837,You don't have to make it,25
4838,with making it,14
4839,Could you help me,17
4840,"0day so u can code a shuffle dumper, correct?",45
4841,ye i see,8
4842,Plus.\n```\n‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:\nThis project is no longer compatible with Hyperion versions  and above.\n```,98
4843,That static decryptor is mainly for detections I would assume,61
4844,can u help me with logic behind a shuffle dupmper i might make that,67
4845,Yes it's the lua environment,28
4846,You need to be in-game to get the current shuffles,50
4847,Because it needs to be in runtime I told you,44
4848,shuffle 7 and that,18
4849,but how come i cant use to get,30
4850,the __cal and stuff,19
4851,it doesa show,13
4852,back to static decompiler,25
4853,You can get them using his dumps,32
4854,so i can get them,17
4855,why not DUMPER?,15
4856,You only need dumps,19
4857,I'm uploading latest client dump,32
4858,not an actual thing to search,29
4859,thats only got like dumps,25
4860,yep ty,6
4861,I told him to message you lol,29
4862,Shuffle dumper is different there's alot more to account for,60
4863,you got any free time to possibly make a simple one to learn from which works?,78
4864,The coding is quite simple logic,32
4865,but if i were to go that route HOW in the hell would i make a shuffle dumper,76
4866,It's a constant learning experience there's always something new to learn,73
4867,And you code whilst reading,27
4868,Common misconception. You don't learn coding by reading you learn by doing,74
4869,ye but like idk c++ and if i were to learn it and that it would take me months to code a dumper and ion rlly wanna use cheat engine,131
4870,That is relatively simple that's how I initially got the shuffles whilst I was making the dumper,96
4871,which i dont really got,23
4872,cuz it seems like this would take ages,38
4873,to get shuffle,14
4874,and actually simple way,23
4875,And then use maths with hex from the base address to get to the different shuffles,82
4876,Look up a video on YouTube it's quite simple,44
4877,Change the name logo etc & change the name of the kernel driver,63
4878,Modified Cheat Engine and kernel,32
4879,And DBVM,8
4880,Maths,5
4881,without roblox detecting it too,31
4882,and how would i theoretically search for those,46
4883,Dumper,6
4884,Just use cheat engine for most shuffles if you don't have a decryptor,69
4885,Ask uniqua he's working on a dumper he might give you a free trial of some dumps or something,93
4886,im new to c# c++ so coding it isnt an option for me,51
4887,so its not possible at all with static to get those shuffle or?,63
4888,I don't think there are any free ones,37
4889,"Realistically you don't even need to make a binary dumper, you can just code a disassembler to dump the values you need",119
4890,got any free ones then?,23
4891,And not one that I'm willing to share. But yeah you can either statically reverse encs or you can integrate it into your dumper with a disasm.,142
4892,also could runtime be used for encs and other ones static has,61
4893,you got any runtime one?,24
4895,dec,3
4896,i also used fish sticks,23
4897,```\n‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE:\nThis project is no longer compatible with Hyperion versions  and above.\n```,91
4898,works for shuffle 3 n that,26
4899,Because there are fake gogo's,29
4900,ye i restarted,14
4901,I mean show me the chat and his profile,39
4902,This is completely different to what you just showed,52
4903,i already built it,18
4904,wdym the link where i got it or the file,40
4905,Show me,7
4906,@gogo1000?,10
4907,gogo,4
4908,Where'd you get your dump,25
4909,but i get this not what he dus,30
4910,ive converted to string n that,30
4911,You've clicked the wrong thing and it's took you elsewhere,58
4912,it shows ts,11
4913,ik but,6
4914,Bruv he told you what to do,27
4915,Mf troll you are my friend,26
4916,as screensshare,15
4917,general,7
4918,can u show ur process in,24
4919,hmm odd,7
4920,this is how it looks like for me,32
4921,which didnt have qword n that,29
4922,"i restarted, they had randoms in them",37
4923,show me a screenshot of your current eventnames,47
4924,and ion got that as my start,28
4925,cuz ik a4 is start of shuffle 7,31
4926,i think they arent,18
4927,but theyre not in order?,24
4928,pretty sure i got all,21
4929,now?,4
4930,done,4
4931,until you have all,18
4932,and repeat it for all the other dword & qwords,46
4933,now go back,11
4934,what i got,10
4935,and press a,11
4936,dwords,6
4937,select those,12
4938,cuz thats what it brung me to,29
4939,is it here im meant to be,25
4940,double click one of the dwords and send me a screenshot,55
4941,nothing got converted,21
4942,double click and press a,24
4943,like right click or what,24
4944,press on the dwords and qwords and convert them to a string,59
4945,like r they in order here too,29
4946,since decompiling brings me to random,37
4947,can i get shuffle 7 order from this aswell,42
4948,i think im getting this then,28
4949,is shuffle 5: a5 s a3 s a2 s a1 s a4,36
4950,ats why i no use,16
4951,ik he got them wrong,20
4952,you got all of them wrong,25
4953,yall is shuffle 3 : a2 s a3 s a1,32
4954,OK,2
4955,but  iwant to save it,21

5012,Further up in chat,18
5013,where i said that i skidded them,32
5014,By myself,9
5015,Wdym ok noob at least I can get shuffle 3 and 5 without skidding,64
5016,"They shows userdata,vector",26
5017,Instead of something like,25
5018,(QWORD),7
5019,It brings me to,15
5020,Like,4
5021,nigga read,10
5022,Function address,16
5023,I didn‚Äôt say,12
5024,wym by function address,23
5025,what is this nigga doing,24
5026,cuz it seems to bring me to function address or sum,51
5027,n that,6
5028,yeah how would i do __table,27
5029,you know uhh for shuffles like shuffle 7,40
5030,ill dm u,8
5031,Well where does roblox use encs,31
5032,Yeah I was connecting it to the dump functions in,49
5033,Found it yup,12
5034,luau/vm/src/,12
5035,where's the proto struct,24
5036,I wanted to keep working on xspy,32
5037,I didn't jave my pc,19
5038,Just use a pc lol,17
5039,why would anyone do that üò≠,26
5040,üòØ,1
5041,for windows,11
5042,using linux,11
5043,like I compiled a dll in android,32
5044,I made a printsploit on android,31
5045,And on portrait mode,20
5046,I'm on phone rn it's fucking hard to read the code on a small ass screen,72
5047,you could have just said vm encs,32
5048,sub,3
5049,add,3
5050,xor,3
5051,do you know what im talking about bro,37
5052,and the state field is obscured by obscurevalue,47
5053,"the ""globalstate"" is actually just a script vmstate",51
5054,length and hash,15
5055,ouhh,4
5056,tstring len and hash,20
5057,I think there's also tstring,28
5058,and more,8
5059,proto->p,8
5060,u will see the members,22
5061,dumpproto,9
5062,dumpudata,9
5063,dumptable,9
5064,dumpclosure,11
5065,u can see some structure members are in dump functions,54
5066,on global state,15
5067,put,3
5068,that u pit,10
5069,the vmvalues,12
5070,he means like,13
5071,is this,7
5072,I think it's,12
5073,roblox doesn't use encs other than for vmstate,46
5074,you mean vm encryptions,23
5075,I think,7
5076,Because I do have a little bit idea about how roblox uses shuffles but I see people talking about the encs,106
5077,roblox encs ?,13
5078,How about robloxs encs,22
5079,^^,2
5080,That's actually simple yet somehow it's affective,49
5081,remove my retard role!!!!!,26
5082,yap yap yap,11
5083,a1 = 1st argument,17
5084,a = argument,12
5085,Yup so a1 becomes a2 a2 becomes a1 and all that in the shuffling process,72
5086,a1 a2 a3,8
5087,the a1 s a2,11
5088,the thing i dont get is,23
5089,#define LUAVM_SHUFFLE3(a1 s a2 s a3) a2 s a1 s a3,49
5090,So it really is self explanatory by the name,44
5091,Ohhhh,5
5092,I saw a simple shuffle definition,33
5093,you're cooked,13
5094,what roblox does,16
5095,1:1,3
5096,if you don't do,15
5097,So when trying to access those and not using shuffle it points you to some different struct member?,99
5098,closure -> l = Lua closure\nclosure -> c = C closure,52
5099,closure,7
5100,like closure,12
5101,most of the members are encrypted,33
5102,Table,5
5103,pro explaining,14
5104,structure members,17
5105,roblox shuffles their uh,24
5106,How are shuffles like used I don't have a complete understanding on it,70
5107,readability & common sense,26
5108,can someone confirm what this man is saying,43
5109,a0 is useless,13
5110,it's either a1 or nothing,25
5111,never use 0,11
5112,then putting in a column,24
5113,and you compare order,21
5114,so u just searching for it,26
5115,roblox dump,11
5116,vector,6
5117,you look up lkke,16
5118,you go to luau/vm/src/,22
5119,"userdata (a0), number (a1), vector (a2) yes",43
5120,it's very simple mate,21
5121,"userdata, table, number, vector",31
5122,That's so easy,14
5123,look at the strings in,22
5124,in luau src,11
5125,I am just gonna help him with 3 rest he can figure out,54

5137,shuffle 3 5 7 8 is from,23
5138,Wbu,3
5139,Fine,4
5140,I havent programmed for like months already,43
5141,dm pls,6
5142,Go in ballistic and search shuffle 3,36
5143,Yoo I'm doing great man,23
5144,haven't heard about you in a whilee,35
5145,I left exploiting scene for like months,39
5146,Okay so there are 7 shuffles in total 3-9 what they do is shuffle some offsets in structs so I will teach you method for 3 thats userdata number vector,151
5147,how are you bro,15
5148,yea man,7
5149,long time bro,13
5150,Is that xspy,12
5151,rizzler,7
5152,Wsp,3
5153,That could actually help me as a learning resource for internals. Not skid,74
5154,rizvee,6
5155,So it's something people are using to skid.,43
5156,can u do in dms so i wont need to search up in coding help 24/7 to find,71
5157,ima start w easiest then progress to harder,43
5158,What shuffle you wanna learn,28
5159,ye i have ballistic now what to do,34
5160,And then xspy took that from him,32
5161,Oh yea I leaked a d3d11 hook which was skidded by yoru,54
5162,Whats ballistic,15
5163,That's 2 am for me almost,25
5164,Do you have ballistic source I don't have time to teach,55
5165,or a dumper,11
5166,how to get for further use,26
5167,like help me get all shuffles so ill know,41
5168,idk nun about shuffles all i know it shuffles,45
5169,can u help me possibly as a base,32
5170,Our,3
5171,Even a 5 year old can figure,28
5172,You can search,14
5173,im tryna learn to get them since ive never done shuffles,56
5174,They are literally strings,26
5175,and sigmagamer confirmed that shuffle 5 is correct now,54
5176,Yes that fucking easiest ones,29
5177,and shuffle 5,13
5178,And begged for them,19
5179,i legit got shuffle 3,21
5180,No you dont even know how to get shuffles,41
5181,bbg please,10
5182,im smart now trust,18
5183,can someone remove retard role from me,38
5184,But paying with time,20
5185,Could work atleast they aren't paying,37
5186,im new to coding n that so could u help w it,44
5187,well atleast key system,23
5188,I don't make stuff paid,23
5189,and earn money,14
5190,Don't know a starting point,27
5191,then u can make it paid,23
5192,u gotta help me code that,25
5193,you bruteforce all fields and build the shuffle,47
5194,to make xeno,12
5195,time to learn,13
5196,I have literally 0 knowledge on internals,41
5197,its easy,8
5198,i thought it was for luau,25
5199,Isn't shuffles used for the vm,30
5200,i swear theres a way to make a shuffle dumper,45
5201,omg noob,8
5202,no not,6
5203,yes secret,10
5204,not secret,10
5205,dont gatekeep,13
5206,then secret,11
5207,I have never worked on internals üò≠,34
5208,u need l->top then l->base,26
5209,It's much more simple,21
5210,how do u even get them,22
5211,ye ig,5
5212,Taskscheduler would be easier,29
5213,me getting shuffle 6 rn,23
5214,but both do it so meh,21
5215,well TaskScheduler::Job too,27
5216,well it works and it aint that hard w it,40
5217,which is easier,15

5561,do you think the devs went through every byte of data on google and hardcoded another case in chatgpt codebase for it,117
5562,lines of code,13
5563,as,2
5564,but how would you use that,26
5565,eys,3
5566,um bloke,8

5576,chatgpt is all just loading and running a model,47
5577,crazy,5

5586,just dont get them wrong,24
5587,next time i need to make sure verify vm values again,52
5588,finally,7
5589,perhaps,7
5590,are you an autistic clown,25

5602,anyone have idea why is this not print?,39
5603,just sending so people can use real ida crack bc when i search to goole ida pro crack theres alot of fake and virus,115
5604,Lmfao,5
5605,Did they use ida to crack ida?,30
5606,rutracker already has ida pro 9 cracked,39
5607,and its from some friend also,29
5608,man i use that one,18
5609,just a guess,12
5610,it looks like a russian malware,31
5611,cheers everyone,15
5612,just login and u can download it,32
5613,heres free ida pro crack,24
5614,anyways every one cheers,24
5615,and any idea on how can ifind it using dump idea,48
5616,to make it work with this,25
5617,what static address should i find,33
5618,ox150,5
5619,on how to use this offset,25
5620,anyone can gi ve me a idea,26
5621,find it in loadstring function,30
5622,okk ty,6
5623,It‚Äôs like putting the code of the function into a new block where it should be called,85
5624,Instead of calling the function and creating a new stack frame it keeps the current and remains in the same function,116
5625,so instead of going to the block of code of the func it pastes it its just faster,81
5626,ok understood,13
5627,ye im reading it but i want some context,40
5628,can u just give me a quick explanation please,45
5629,what does that mean.,20
5630,luau_load is inlined,20
5631,what are they used for bro?,27

5703,the lua state?,14
5704,"Well , DecryptState we can say",30
5705,GetGlobalStateForInstance and decrypt it,40
5706,You should try asking Roblox support,36
5707,by asking roblox support they will help,39
5708,Does anyone know ways of getting the Lua state without the task scheduler or function hooking?,94
5709,Can someone explain how do u find game functions and hook them pwetty pwease,76
5710,pasters get no help sry,23
5711,you pasted it,13
5712,its because,11
5713,uhm,3

5874,!!!,3
5875,If I crashed it was cus of my custom funcs (aka my code),56
5876,not a single crash,18
5877,Im serious lol,14
5878,I doubt,7
5879,after properly implementing to run on the scheduler,51
5880,using luau_load,15
5881,Ive had no stability issues,27
5882,setting up a whole ovm is pure pain,35
5883,I doubt that bytecode conversion is worse,41
5884,clvms has terrible performance but still better than bytecode conversion,72
5885,/ stability,11
5886,worse performance,17
5887,"setup your ovm, very easy id say lol",36
5888,who would tho,13
5889,if they want to use bytecode conversion,39
5890,instead of forcing people to learn to update the luau source,60
5891,somebody will probably be retarded though and leak it,53
5892,perfect,7
5893,no more 2016 bytecode compression methods from github,53
5894,when compressing,16
5895,bytecode hashes,15
5896,isnt roblox using blake3 for hashing,36
5897,Which will either cause somebody to leak the new hashes and how to load the new bytecode or just completely make people stop using LuaVM::Load,142
5898,there will be no point of abusing wintrust as long as they have integrity checks,80
5899,Cus I dont reverse hyperion,27
5900,Neither do I know depending on how they add it,46
5901,wont know how to,16
5902,but  of people,14
5903,Obviously,9
5904,That could be bypassed  hypothetically,38
5905,new hashes and signed bytecode,30
5906,they are also updating the bytecode soon,40
5907,and another dll,15
5908,on whole,8
5909,as long as they dont remap it,29
5910,"and how are they patching wintrust, its already a protected module",66
5911,that use SWHX,13
5912,gonna divert even more skids,28
5913,im just mentioning it,21
5914,nothin,6
5915,what wintrust patching has to do with new ChaCha20 quarters,59
5916,Huh,3
5917,/ byte patch,12
5918,so is the WinVerifyTrust hook,29
5919,because gogo's is patched there,31
5920,Only point in using it is once they release hyperion,52
5921,"I surely believe you, dont worry",32
5922,name me public dumper with offsets like iscorescript and moduleflags,68
5923,bro okay haha,13
5924,its my own,10
5925,and enough to clown on u,24
5926,which is already pathetic,25
5927,Ur claiming that its your own code,34
5928,Why would you use it,20
5929,i got my own offset dumper for external exploit,47
5930,Game method is just factually worse,35
5931,thats funny,11
5932,U wouldnt be able to get one offset without public tools,56
5933,its also didnt appear after waiting 1 hour,42
5934,so am I,7
5935,and im using gogo decryptor,27
5936,i dont,6
5937,I have that,11
5938,i remember that there was no xref for taskscheduler::job string or something,76
5939,I dont remember them either,27
5940,why would you name them or why would you remember them,54
5941,why would I tho,15
5942,surely you remember atleast one,31
5943,What do you mean how,20
5944,then name me them,17
5945,Ive used gogos decryptor once and it couldnt decrypt certain strings,68
5946,that gogos / fishys wouldnt have,32
5947,But name me a few xrefs,23
5948,"that doesnt prove your point either, i know u dont need them generally",70
5949,"I never said you need them, but if you want to analyse the module or doing a proper reversal, yes.",98
5950,Do you need them?,17
5951,gogo doesnt decrypt lot of things afaik,39
5952,"certain strings remain encrypted due to gogos tool being unable to decrypt some memory pages statically, as I said if you want to make a proper decryption tool write your own",174
5953,even without beautifying,24
5954,fishy's is enough to get everything,35
5955,but u dont really need to make ur own one,41
5956,pe tools is very pro dumper trust,33
5957,the most u could do with ur own version is do it all in one,59
5958,in ur own dumper,16
5959,I dont know what u would make better,36
5960,beautifying is enough after u dumped,36
5961,"If you want a proper decryption tool write your own, these are not the best",75
5962,unless they get patched,23
5963,just write your own,19
5964,fishys is better,16
5965,they both bad tho,17

5988,wouldn't hyperion just be able to scan for the clone though,59
5989,for windows 10 x64,18
5990,I just used the iso,19
5991,i burn personally cs my win install is clean,44
5992,workstation pro*,16
5993,workstation is free,19
5994,Cant I just download it,23
5995,u js need to burn win iso,25
5996,I used it before,16
5997,yeah I know,11
5998,vmware workstation has gotten much better also there are free keys i think on github you can just search for them,113
5999,vmware is free,14
6000,I never had a use for em,24
6001,it comes with vmware,20
6002,get vmware install vmtools,26
6003,I barely use VMs,16
6004,no shit they run like ass then,30
6005,Dunno what that is,18
6006,do u have vmtools installed on them..,37
6007,but cant find any good ones,27
6008,Probably shitty config,22
6009,saves a lot of time,19
6010,bro then what you just pray for that to not crash,49
6011,slow asf for me even though I have good specs,45
6012,vms are ass,11
6013,I dont use vms,14
6014,to test them,12
6015,you can use a vm atleast,24
6016,a day,5
6017,atleast 5+ times,16
6018,I BSOD like,11
6019,shouldnt brick ur PC,20
6020,BSOD's,6
6021,but just alone,14
6022,It probably did something then,30
6023,ye he turned on kernel debugging,32
6024,windbg bricked my pc üôè,22
6025,bluescreens dont brick your PC,30
6026,any one got current roblox offsets,34
6027,I dont work with drivers causes blue screens or bricking your pc too good luck I am gonna try to update the integrity check bypass,130
6028,dead code mania,15
6029,dbvm messes up the sys call and ret instructions for hyperion to detect I think,79
6030,Gogo1000 explained that well I think,36
6031,for it to be loadable,21
6032,shouldnt take alot of changes,29
6033,neither,7
6034,ill probably just edit the driver,33
6035,Dunno how to do allat,21
6036,or hijack amd/intels shitty drivers,35
6037,but then you have to load with kdmapper,39
6038,they detect signing being off,29
6039,well rather the drivers,23
6040,yea thats a better idea,23
6041,for me that never worked I tried disabling dse Driver signature enforcement,75
6042,Probably just gonna update the DBVM,35
6043,Yeah I dont use vms,19
6044,yea I think you gotta use a vm to make that work,48
6045,hyperdbg weird asf,18
6046,or atleast all x regions,24
6047,it does,7
6048,but I remeber the start of the dll doesnt have an integrity check you can write whatever you want,97
6049,taskscheduler job,17
6050,the integrity check on the .text section is handled by a job,60
6051,that might be applied from the exe then?,40
6052,I think it was,14
6053,only on .text and .rdata?,25
6054,on all sections,15
6055,I know the .exe doesnt have an integrity check,46
6056,Im not sure,11
6057,wait the entire dll doesnt have an integrity check right,56
6058,a clone that hasnt been tampered with,37
6059,from the dlls base address,26
6060,especially because everything is offsetted,42
6061,I think thats method 2 which makes a clone and redirects the integrity check,76
6062,from what I can see,19
6063,It does nothing in the .exe,27
6064,"int3's encryptpacket, encryptpacket and getearlydigests\n\nMakes a clone that hasnt been changed (of the memory)\n\nand idk exactly what method 1 does",150
6065,I have only seen him in uc so dk,32
6066,It just,7
6067,I thought you were friends with him,35
6068,I dont know him personally no,29
6069,you know 0avx right,19
6070,but were talking about AVX's bypass,35
6071,chacha and blake3 exist within .exe not dll,43
6072,or well its memory,18
6073,with the .exe,13
6074,AVX's bypass doesnt interact,28
6075,I don't reverse hyperion much focusing more on execution,56
6076,not the dll,11
6077,let me check it out,19
6078,listen I asked my friend he told me the integrity check is in the exe,69
6079,misread it then,15
6080,oh nvm,6
6081,which is a database lol,23
6082,I think u said HyperDb,22
6083,HyperDbg,8
6084,cant find it,12
6085,oh thats like a hypervisor debugger which anti malware devs use i think,71
6086,u dont need to update it,24
6087,Idk why he said,15
6088,the addresses change,20
6089,you stil ldo,12
6090,isn't method 3 the one where you dont need to update anything,61
6091,or wtv u said,13
6092,what is HyperDB,15
6093,thats gives an error I think that might be noaccess,51
6094,oh also for some reason you cant read memory where the ic is located,68
6095,int3,4
6096,it doesnt nop it,16
6097,actually nvm,12
6098,method 3 nops it,16
6099,I think 2 is better cus that creates a clone I forgot what 1 does method 3 changes the hash at runtime,102
6100,not 2,5
6101,method 1,8
6102,also I was tryna use,20
6103,its the dll not .exe,20
6104,but yeah,8
6105,he doesnt combine them he uses the size for smth else,53
6106,and then Start + Size,21
6107,+ OffsetToStartOfHyperion,25
6108,should be in the dll yea,24
6109,why would it be .text section,29
6110,I was thinking its the DLL,26
6111,Its not  is it,14
6112,.text?,6
6113,codestart = get .text virtualaddr & virtualsize then align them down to the nearest page boundary\ncodesize = align section size up to nearest multiple of page size,164
6114,SectionEndAddress - SectionStartAddress = Size,46
6115,yea in ce thats code size i think,33
6116,I think my friend found that,28
6117,the section size,16
6118,isnt that just,14
6119,I only know method for code start and size,42
6120,even I couldn't,15
6121,thats the one with creating a cloned page to redirect their integrity check,75
6122,I didnt mean Cached,19
6123,yeah I couldnt find EarlyDigests,32
6124,which method are you trying method 2 is easier I think you only need codestart and size and earlydigests,104
6125,for just hooking it,19
6126,cus youll probably be detected,30
6127,Probably better to use a DBVM either way,40
6128,EncryptPacket is easy to find,29
6129,I meant GetEarlyDigests,23
6130,actually nvm I didnt even try finding that,42
6131,CachedHashes,12
6132,I forgot what its called,24
6133,it was the other one that was needed,36
6134,was tryna find it without a sig though,38
6135,I couldnt find one func,23
6136,from their ic,13
6137,I doubt thats changing localscripts that gets you detected more like they are detecting you use write process memory,116
6138,my friend did,13
6139,the bypass is simple enough you can even make that into an external,67
6140,works too,9
6141,or use hyperdbg,15
6142,to set a BP,11
6143,then make CE's DBVM work,24
6144,if u dont wanna update AVX's integrity check bypass,51
6145,if its 0 then theres none,25
6146,= violation,11
6147,r12 + 32,8
6148,Hook the function that hyperion uses to encrypt them,52
6149,any reliable way I can see that hyperion has detected me? perhaps packets?,74
6150,some get loaded on character reset,34
6151,I dunno,7
6152,I mean probably,15
6153,so it's a select few?,21
6154,that would require you to change it before it gets loaded,57
6155,also why LocalScript,20
6156,Probably is depending on the Script,35
6157,since you don't reply in DMs perhaps you know if changing localscript's source is DTC by hyperion?\nI know solara changes corescripts but are localscripts checked?,163
6158,takes one to know one,21
6159,cuz they are retarded,21
6160,Why so many people needs the nuclear retard role,48
6161,üò§,1
6162,ok now u are woman not boy,26
6163,shush woman u have no rights,28
6164,i got lovre and rondoxkay as my good boys,41
6165,tomboy,6
6166,now u gonna be my good boyüòà,27
6167,fuck LGTBQ+ 500hz shit tho,26
6168,haha femboy,11
6169,i love that,11
6170,trans role,10
6171,wohoo,5
6172,watch freaky russian speedrun GPT prompt,40
6173,"hint, is not junk",17
6174,do you know what the .byfron section is,39
6175,she loves jumping on my stick,29
6176,make her femboy with no rights,30
6177,ok noob make sure to kill yourself,34
6178,afk 1sec,8
6179,but i can,9
6180,here u said that i cant answer them,35
6181,so that means i know basics,27
6182,and anti tamper,15
6183,all u know abt hyperion is that its a DLL,41
6184,best response,13
6185,that im incorrect or something,30
6186,so what u trying to say,23
6187,source trust me bro,19
6188,"ah yes, DLLs are a dunamic link that a exe can use",50
6189,Thanks,6
6190,So u can now shut,17
6191,He woulda clowned u if u didn't fix,35
6192,No u shut,9
6193,now u can shut,14
6194,lemme fix my sentence,21
6195,Not a exe file can use a dll,28
6196,U said that a dll can use a exe file,36
6197,yes u can call certain function from dll,40
6198,Is it not the other way round blud,34
6199,Dlls that can use some exe file,31
6200,read what i said after dynamic link library,43
6201,that isnt the point,19
6202,fuck no obv dlls are dynamic link libraries,43
6203,Tbh hydra n that free offset servers r full of them,51
6204,a dynamic link library that some exe file can use it and call functions from it for example,91
6205,ok mad femboy noob,18
6206,this server would be dead without skids,39
6207,20 mins of deep researches to find out what hyperion is ü•∂,57
6208,u dont even know what a DLL is,30
6209,took u nearly 20 mins to reply at the easiest question,54
6210,good boy stay quiet,19
6211,beg me,6
6212,i didnt stop,12
6213,in  very pro answer,19
6214,but still working for now,25
6215,this going to get patched in next update cus of chatGPT,55
6216,to make skids stop yapping ask them basic hyperion questions and he will dodge 100% accurate,92
6217,beg me for staying quiet too,28
6218,good boy now stay quiet,23
6219,beg me and ill think maybe,26
6220,question,8
6221,reply to,8
6222,and make me femboy moderator,28
6223,btw make femboyvote,19
6224,with she/her pronounces,23
6225,no explanation = no rights and u are femboy,43
6226,"what ""bro..."" femboy nigger",27
6227,tell me where hyperion resides at,33
6228,Bro...,6
6229,so whats wroing,15
6230,i answered its anti tamper,26
6231,u said that i barely know what is hyperion,42
6232,ur basic questions,18
6233,but i know,10
6234,ok femboy,9
6235,"bytecode signing check, what a great discover",45
6236,guys freaky russian set capabilities we are doomed,50
6237,u gonna be gay,14
6238,not okay,8
6239,i jsut did,10
6240,specially when u cant answer such basic questions,49
6241,watch how u gonna be femboy,27
6242,its funny playing with you,26
6243,make her femboy,15
6244,this bitch cant stop arguing bro,32
6245,pin his msg pls,15
6246,shush woman,11
6247,"wow ur claiming that hyperion is an anti tamper, dont leak this private information else bitdancer will raid u",110
6248,so im pro,9
6249,but im correct,14
6250,ok mad noob,11
6251,‚ùå üß†,3
6252,Thats indeed idiot,18
6253,anti tamper,11
6254,whole .text is junk,19
6255,"if it differs, it was modified",30
6256,all they do is comparing it to previously genereated hashes,59
6257,you barely know what hyperion is,32
6258,underaged,9
6259,mad noob,8
6260,üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ,5
6261,Im helping you!,15
6262,what u trying to say,20
6263,did you know its undetected,27
6264,btw u should try writing to signed modules Code Caves,53
6265,just tell me that u dont know,29
6266,the most basic shit,19
6267,u just cant answer,18
6268,mad because of what,19
6269,do you even know what the .text section contains,48
6270,no answer,9
6271,easiest question,16
6272,retarded,8
6273,very based,10
6274,do yk how roblox .text section monitor works,44
6275,and setting capabilities is not basic when pixelated still didnt set them,73
6276,i know detections like when u change bytecode u get detection once it checks for original code,94
6277,setting capabilities is basic,29
6278,how can u be considered a good developer,40
6279,you are not aware of some simple detections checks roblox has placed recently,77
6280,no im pro,9
6281,you are not a good cheat developer,34
6282,who pinged me here,18
6283,im telling why im good at cheat developer since u telling me to quit,68
6284,something we agree on,21
6285,everything here is pasted and detected,38
6286,gang shii ah word word,22
6287,idrc about your pasted externals,32
6288,ur detected,11
6289,just look at api_incr_top,25

6962,Jobs,4
6963,Have you come across a function that has ScriptContext as an argument and gets called preferably every update?,110
6964,You still need help?,20
6965,The problem is that function only gets called when launching a game. Is there a function with Script Context as one of its arguments that gets called all the time?,163
6967,Can someone with IDA on Windows search for this string?\n`Can't initialize the TaskScheduler before flags have been loaded`,123
6968,Alright,7
6969,the sub_10329D10E initializes the scheduler,43
6970,I'm not 100% sure on mac Roblox internals,41
6971,Which could contain the scheduler,33

6978,But it is 0 for some reason,27
6979,104C0B1E8 is supposed to contain the address to task scheduler,62
6980,why switching to mac os then to windows then back to mac os,59
6981,Alright then,12
6982,It gets FrameTime instead of scheduler on macOS,47
6983,The first one,13
6984,I provided an image of it,25
6985,That sub with no args is getscheduler,37
6986,Ye that's it,12
6987,It's different for me. That function is getting FrameTime offset instead,72
6988,I don't recall job offsets,26
6989,Then the call right above the one with the FrameTime string is getscheduler,75
6990,2nd xref,8
6991,"Search ""FrameTime""",18

7012,just get inside of initalthermalstatus,38
7013,I did find a ` /` though,24
7014,ok wait lemme open ida,22
7015,There's two occurences of `initialThermalStatus` and both don't have a `/ 1000` nearby,86
7016,then find some sub with / 1000,30
7017,initialThermalStatus,20
7018,search in strings,17
7019,"How do you find the getTaskScheduler function? I was sure it was not on macOS earlier, but I think it is now",108
7020,so its correctly getting task scheduler i think,47
7021,it gets jobs from task scheduler,32
7022,cuz like,8

7037,Any other ways to get Lua state?,32
7038,"Well, ballistic also uses the task scheduler to get script context and then Lua state",85
7039,it not uses script context,26
7040,for windows paste ballistic,27
7041,Is the task scheduler on Windows also broken?,45
7042,"I am on macOS, so you don't need to do the decrypted/encrypted states thing like on Windows",91
7043,"You can do getGlobalState(scriptContext, &identity, &script)",60
7044,For the Lua state,17
7045,why do u need script context,28

7374,cool I will tryna add those to my dumper,40
7375,public execution when,21
7376,whos a ui designer,18
7377,may it serve someone in the future,34
7378,attributes are stored in Instance -> OnDemandInstance* (+0x30) -> Attributes array (+0xE8),90
7379,found it,8
7380,"you can try finding the vftable for RBX::Instance, then finding the GetAttribute method and seeing how it retrieves the attribute",129
7381,if I find something I'll share it here perhaps someone can use it,65
7382,will look further then,22
7383,"i was looking for it but can't find it, at least for now",56
7384,my best guess is theres an std::map or std::set somewhere in the instance,73
7385,because different instances of the same class share descriptors,63
7386,theyre not gonna be in the classdecriptor,41
7387,ye i get ur point,17
7388,"player:GetAttribute(""Role"") in murder mystery for example gives you directly whether someone is murderer/sheriff, that's just one use case and a lot of games use them, but I can't find them",189
7389,they're not gonna be in the class descriptor,44
7390,forgot those were a thing,25
7391,oh right,8
7392,"no, i mean literally attributes",31
7393,by attributes do you mean properties?,37
7394,any what I can get a list of attributes of an instance externally? like is it in the class descriptor or somewhere else stored in an array perhaps?,147
7395,what did i just read,20
7396,Ur lil dick won't even reach my inside,38
7397,id rape ya,10
7398,WOWW SUPER WOWWWW VERY GOOD,27
7399,MANGO MANGO MANGO response,26
7400,the sandbox is process all access,33
7401,He sandboxed roblox and has all the control!!!,46
7402,If  you cant touch the game externally how are you willing to inject your internal code,87
7403,Bru stop mate y'all proving my point more watch how normal people understand what I'm saying,92
7404,answer this,11
7405,Shut tf up u gay mf,19
7406,Ah okay since i said some random bs,35
7407,Him,3
7408,Me or lovre,11
7409,U just said we're right fucking nigger,38
7410,Trust,5
7411,And they query the physical pages to overflow the external memory that exceeds on the NX in the PTE fastcall 3rd argoument,122
7412,So its external,15
7413,Solara reads roblox physical memory with a um bridge,52
7414,I am not even. If I am cant believe a skid is smarter than ya,61
7415,Oh no,5
7416,I'm fucking 15 and still taller than both of ya,47
7417,But he cant without GPT,23
7418,Hes some edgy 13yo tryna prove their point,42

7420,Bet ur brain. Is small too,26
7421,Yes be a short mf,17
7422,Are u even above 6 foot,23
7423,If a syscall exceeds its args where are they passed into,56
7424,I meant what kind of question of that,37
7425,This guy,8
7426,I swear,7
7427,roblox uses xor to encrypt pages,32
7428,üò∞,1
7429,I FUCKING use gogo decrypt,26

7436,u cant be crying now,20
7437,STFU,4
7438,SEE U SLOW FUCK,15
7439,WHY CCHANGE IT,14
7440,Name one thing inside the Robloxs IC.,37
7441,why change now?,15
7442,BC YALL WONT BELIEVE,20
7443,OMFG,4
7444,ARE U SLOW?,11
7445,I CREATE A PROOF,16
7446,you cant be real asking gpt what rpm and wpm is,47
7447,GOT DESTROYED,13
7448,Who decided to give whatmanvisor smartest role,46
7449,It describes what the function does,35
7450,"So why does solara include code called ""synchronize_to_external""? If solara is 100% external, I don't see why it would have any code that would need to synchronize with an external part?",186
7451,AND WHERE DOES THE BYTECODE GO?,31
7452,Why is this so true,19
7453,"Why would you waste your time explaining why Solara is external to such incompetent individual, Id rather take this time to go gambling instead",143
7454,MF HOW RU SUPPOSED TO TOUCH IT IF ITS FUCKING EXTERNAL,54
7455,ure the retard one,18
7456,u said this,11
7457,be quiet,8
7458,Source leak = Skidsgiving,25
7459,Skidfest,8
7460,On god,6
7461,Am i classified as competent!!!,31
7462,They are,8
7463,Sproute,7
7464,Im done,7
7465,HOLY FGCUK,10
7466,FINALLY BRO thanks mate,23
7467,That needs to synchronize with external code,44
7468,So you have code running internally in Roblox,45
7469,GOT COOKED,10
7470,OMG HOLY FUCK,13
7471,SEEE,4
7472,And that code that's written is then ran by Roblox,50
7473,U fuck tard,11
7474,Be quiet xero,13
7475,That needs to sync with the external?,37
7476,Could it be that it's internal code,35
7477,"Why is this called ""synchronize_to_external""?",45
7478,Whats the point.,16
7479,Hi so   \n,10
7480,keep laughing bud I'll stand on my point,40
7481,SAY THAT TO FUCKING EVERYONE HERE,33
7482,learn basic hacking,19
7483,FULLY,5
7484,Go read win7 sysinternals and game hacking guides pls,53
7485,THATS WHAT I SAID,17
7486,I SAID FULLY EXTERNAL,21
7487,we all waiting for it,21
7488,SEEE THATS WHAT I SAID,22
7489,retard role when,16
7490,HOLY MF,7
7491,You said that bytecode swapping is internal. Which already proves your point wrong,82
7492,THATS WHAT I SAID FUCKINGFULLY EXTERANL,39
7493,HOW MF,6
7494,you didnt. I proved your point wrong,36
7495,someone did,11
7496,I dont think so,15
7497,Did you ever mention that bytecode swapping is external,55
7498,u slow monkey,13
7499,without touching the internal memory or code internally,55
7500,FUCKING HELL BE QUIET STOP FUCKING IGNORING WHAT I SAID,55
7501,It does modify the roblox execution flow,40
7503,i said fully,12
7504,BRO THEY DONT,13
7505,BRO THATS WHAT I SAID FULLY EXTERNAL DO NOT TOUCH THE GAME,58
7506,FUCKING slap ON YALL FACE,25
7508,yes ure right im actuakly wrong about external,46
7509,THAT MAKES SOLARA FUCKING INTENRAL,34
7510,and solara does this shit,25
7511,And Solara does that,20
7512,im loosing hopes on you,23
7513,Do you know how roblox crash handler works,42
7514,Watch this,10
7515,Bru,3
7516,But this guy is pointless,25
7517,Not only obv,12
7518,It is tho,9
7519,Not that I meant like,21
7520,so you CANT touch the game being external... Good Point!,56
7521,U need to touch the game which makes it internal brom,53
7522,It requires internal bro.,25
7523,bro youre russian go back to youre country pls!,47
7524,How is a fully external gonna touch the game,44
7525,Y'all slow as hell ngl,22
7526,mf,2
7527,slightly... this guy got no idea,32
7528,i think your brain might be slightly damaged,44
7529,FUCKING FULLY EXTERNAL DONT FUCKING TOCYH THE FUCKING GAME,58
7530,go ahead,8
7531,Let me explain it to u,22
7532,it proves his big retardness.,29
7533,That doesnt prove your point,28
7534,Wait that's not what I'm trying to say,38
7535,Woof send this bytecode  then Roblox will accept it like a good girl?,69
7536,So basically what u believe is,30
7537,Go ahead,8
7538,I explain it,12
7539,You can,7
7540,U CANT EDIT SHIT BY FULLY EXTERNAL,34
7541,dont be suprised,16
7542,IT IS MF,8
7543,is crazy,8
7544,Dodging me,10
7545,Millie has  bigger brain than all of ya,39
7546,That doesnt make solara internal,32
7547,"Mate, explain why. Instead of agreeing on every bullshit millie is saying.",74
7548,Wowwww,6
7549,Fucking magic,13
7550,U think u can fucking edit something without touching it,56
7551,Youre the one who's stupid as f,31
7552,No Millie is right,18
7553,Youre stupid af,15
7554,Hes right,9
7555,Shut tf up,10
7556,Why is this so real,19
7557,Thanks mate I cant think of something to prove it bc English isn't my real langjage,83
7558,"I feel like you dont get the basics.  As i said, go learn Assault Cube hacking",78
7559,Ima go eat smth,15
7560,Isn't that crazy,16
7561,It needs to communicate with an external part which can,55
7562,Because the internal Luau part cannot write files to the system,63
7563,let this kid talk,17
7564,So ah,5
7565,It is,5
7566,Is that related,15
7567,How about you explain how filesystem functions are implemented in executors like Solara?,88
7568,Fucking alot,12
7569,To send scripts,15
7570,Yeah my internal needs some form of IPC to communicate between the DLL and the UI,81
7571,For what tasks exactly,22
7572,Do you think *internals* requires a bridge,42
7573,u want me to make it simple  for u?,35
7574,Is this your explaination,25
7575,You dont know either what Millie is yapping about. Let this guy talk,68
7576,U believe in magic,18
7577,Point stands,12
7578,No counter arguments made,25
7579,BRUH HE EXPLAIN IT ALREADY,26
7580,"Why dont you talk, explain why solara is internal by yourself instead of agreeing on every bullshit that millie is saying.",122
7581,MF U CANT THINK OF A REASON SO U QUIET,38
7582,Fr,2
7583,Wouldn't that be a crazy theory,31
7584,Or perhaps there's some communication between the UI and some internal part in Roblox that receives the bytecode and runs it,124
7585,Bc u have a brainproblem,24
7586,Is that your point,18
7587,Does Roblox just magically know to run it?,42
7588,So what happens to the bytecode?,32
7589,I cant take this seriously,26
7590,be quiet mate,13
7591,I feel like youre joking,24
7592,NAH,3
7593,Thats complete bs,17
7594,Why so quiet now,16
7595,SEE,3
7596,"So when you press execute in the solara UI, it takes the Luau code, compiles it, and then does what? What happens to the bytecode?",130
7597,"Sometimes i feel like yall dont get the basics, go learning Assault Cube game hacking and come back talking.",108
7598,Fucking do it out of air,24
7599,If it's fully external how tf is solara gonna run a code inside,63
7600,BRUH HIS RIGHT,14
7601,You make me feel smarter than i actually am,43
7602,Cookedüò≠,7
7603,Because the Roblox exploiting community has one collective braincell they all take turns at using,97
7604,How do u think it runs code without touching it,47
7605,It's right bro,14
7606,I told that to people and people say I'm dumb,45
7607,This guy actually thinks like me,32
7608,Immune is literally incompetent,31
7609,Ye,2
7610,Wym so Nihon is a skid?,23
7611,"If solara was fully external, why does it need a bridge to send bytecode from the external part?? Maybe because there's an internal part that needs to receive and run the bytecode????",183
7612,And I stand by it,17
7613,are you the guy that said solara is internal,44
7614,Every skid is using it,22
7615,It's a shitty method though,27
7616,Can u do it tho?,16
7617,Swhx injection is like 5 function calls,39
7618,That just proved his good at it,31
7619,He created a setwindowhook ex injector + winverify injector in 1 minute,71
7620,How convenient,14
7621,It's in video call,18
7622,How about you give proof of him actually doing anything? Has he ever written any code?? Like he's constantly in these chats but I've never seen him write a single line if code,175
7623,Well he clearly taught you poorly cuz you don't know shit,57
7624,I'm defending him bc his good and teached me,44
7625,Give me proof and ill believe uüò≠,32
7626,I don't believe u maye,22
7627,And all he does is bully skids because they weren't as spoonfed as he is,72
7628,He hasn't released a single piece of software,45
7629,Idk why you're defending him,28
7630,He's spoonfed and larping about it,34
7631,"No name comes into the scene, begs a bunch of people for spoonfeeds and two weeks later acts as if he reversed everything himself",129
7632,how do u know his a skid?,25
7633,I'm sure woffle with his expertise did as well,46
7634,Skids were able to figure out how to fake UNC,45
7635,I don't care,12
7636,but i swear he send one before,30
7637,i cant find it,14
7638,wait i think he send me before,30
7639,Awesome,7
7640,Wow printsploit,15
7641,Or just screenshots of a UNC tests?,35
7642,Any proof of this?,18
7643,must be 99 percent now,22
7644,fr tho his good mate it has 93 percent unc last last montj i think,66
7645,Stop defending him,18
7646,Wow he pasted ballistic ü§Ø,25
7647,he will release it,18
7648,he has a private exploit,24
7649,He's just like fishy or yoru,28
7650,He just acts as if he knows his shit and people fall for it,59
7651,You ever seen him actually release anything?,44
7652,Average at best,15
7653,and still good at coding,24
7654,He's larping,12
7655,pure skill,10
7656,no pasting,10
7657,i saw him code it,17
7658,his still a geneius,19
7659,üëè,1
7660,Wow he pasted a swhx injector and updated ballistic,51
7661,Woffle is no genius,19
7662,woffle teached me that his a geniuses fr,40
7663,im not tho,10
7664,this server is full of geniuses,31
7665,genius,6
7666,SO IT IS,8
7667,i wonder,8
7668,can u combine setwindowhookex and winverify?,44
7669,if you know basic assembly it should be easy to do it yourself,62
7670,also its literally just patching winverifytrust to return 0,59
7671,1000 dollars,12
7672,give me a injector and ill try my best to create the dll,56
7673,"even if you were to use anything else, if you don't design your exploit good enough, you will be detected by engine checks anyway",129
7674,i tried fixing it for months now,32
7675,idk why it has many errors,26
7676,some guy give me their code mate it has that,44
7677,nah stop lying setwindowhookex use that,39
7678,"Can confirm, I use this in my executor",38
7679,ik close handle,15
7680,im not that dumb bro,20
7681,"best injection method is FreeLibrary(GetModuleHandleW(""""));",59
7682,You just now realized?,22
7683,they saying its detected,24
7684,letsnot use SetWindowsHookEx,28
7685,i just realized it now,22
7686,why didnt i understand it,25
7687,people tricked me many times bruh,33
7688,ud? oooo undetected,19
7689,100% UD,7
7690,people said that swhx is the best injection method to me,56
7691,real',5
7692,It's either incognito or antagonist,35
7693,He wants to update his external,31
7694,theres wayss to execute WITHOUT bytecode replacement,52
7695,Just what we needed: another incognito,38
7696,"can I find the RenderView offset of studio in IDA?\njust trying to make it easier to update my external, i cba to try internal atm",130
7697,"then, you very bad doxer",24

7735,manually mapping is probably better though,42
7736,or remap  with page_execute_writecopy and then you can patch winverifytrust again (unpatch winverifytrust after and remap back to rx),133
7737,you can also manually map the dll,33

7873,in the packet itself,20
7874,I dont think thats handled,26

7897,not userids,11
7898,How to elevate permissions for c# program?,42
7899,as the first arg,16
7900,OnServerEvent has a Player instance,35
7901,then what,9
7902,so that isnt the issue,22
7903,I also have all of them,23
7904,they have been the same,23
7905,Theres no rotating packet IDs,29
7906,you dont know how packets work do u,35
7907,Ty for info,11
7908,Synapse z support itüòé,21

7911,you were able to set / update datastores,40
7912,they had a vuln with their datastore cloud api,46
7913,Roblox is pretty tarded bro,27
7914,senders ip will be redirected to their Player instance,54
7915,they defnitely have,19
7916,to replicate events,19
7917,or use raknet packets,21
7918,youll have to call a roblox function,36
7919,ü™Ñ,1
7920,let's call the raknet wizard instead,36
7921,are you sure that firesignal won't work,39
7922,ok then no I don't have,23
7923,firesignal alone wont work,26
7924,or what,7
7925,do u have a way to replicate events,35
7926,yeah I should give it a try,27
7927,which could be pretty useful in some games lol,46
7928,If roblox hasnt thought of it you can probably fire the event as another person,79
7929,OnServerEvent is an replicable event,36
7930,you nil  to access onserverevent,32
7931,how tf would that work,22
7932,this one isn't made by me,25
7933,mine is a little bit diff but it's basically the same shit by nulling the event,79
7934,full luau remote spy,20
7936,one moment,10
7937,since it got leaked i'll post the method here,45
7938,you can without any hookmetamethod and hookfunction,51
7939,sob_pray,8
7940,how the fuck do u plan on making a ‚Äúprivate rspy‚Äù‚Ä¶,50
7941,meaning no rspy,15
7942,if no hookmetamethod or hookfunction is supported,49
7943,wtf are u talking abt,21
7944,yall tweaking,13

7959,im making tons of progress wym,30
7960,void mbmb fr,12
7961,wait nvm,8
7962,maybe because its a constant security id or,43
7963,visual studio said to put it as const,37
7964,idk why its const though,24
7966,EZZ,3
7967,BRO W,5
7968,guess ill just see,18
7969,but can i still declare constructor like dat if i did pub then name then priv then sec id but wheere would constructor go,121
7970,and the name public,19
7971,I want the security id privatea,31
7972,ik its private,14
7973,why is the constructor private,30
7974,and name public,15
7975,but i want the social security to be private,44
7976,and bank will hold info about users,35
7977,user class,10
7978,im gonna have this:,19
7979,i wanna know how to do it inside,32
7980,BUT,3
7981,ThumbsUp,8
7982,i can prob do the constructor outside,37
7983,now write something that requires low level knowledge,53
7984,idk how to make a class with private and public (the constructor part),70
7985,i just ran into an issue,24
7986,i almost finished,17
7987,my knowledge is better then 9999999999999999999999.999999999999% of skids,73
7988,considering i started like 2 days ago,37

7990,why are u not smart,19
7991,u have a smart role,19
7992,wait a min,10
7993,im still learning c++,21
7994,or just do the c++ version,26
7995,C is like english but fancy,27
7996,arent they pretty similar,25
7997,but isnt C just like cpp but less glorified,43
7998,does that mean i needa learn C,30
7999,no headers,10
8000,C file,6
8001,just libs,9
8002,headers or?,11
8003,not api,7
8004,driver api or,13
8005,for driver?,11
8006,what api's are those,20
8007,```\n#include <>\n#include <>\n#include <>\n#include <>\n#include <>\n```,73
8008,just a few wintypes?,20

8011,it uses win api only?,21
8012,wwhhasdjasn,11
8013,fffff,5
8014,i didnt read it fast enough,27
8015,what libs does it use,21

8017,i saw it used HANDLE,20
8018,what win types did that use,27
8019,b,1
8020,u wanna learn coding?,21
8021,ok but,6
8022,small documentation:\n,22
8023,no its a powerful driver,24
8024,just referencing the driver?,28
8025,like that driver?,17
8026,like what topics,16
8027,the goal is to NOT skid,23
8028,but where can i learn to make my own,36
8029,idk how it would be if its ring0 üíÄ,34
8030,not sure üíÄ,10
8031,wait idk,8
8032,even custom 1 idk,17
8033,kernel drivers detycetd,23
8034,i seen 3249294929 kids teaching me saying,41
8035,but is it  detected,19
8036,its different than others,25
8037,i have one,10
8038,would it have,13
8039,what features,13
8040,I can give myself 5 hrs üôÇ,25
8041,im the one doing,16
8042,you are the one tracking time,29
8043,you and me wym,14
8044,there is no we,14
8045,we can do it tmmrw frfr,23
8046,i need to sleep though,22
8047,thats the goal?,15
8048,I'll give you 5 hours,21
8049,u want me to make a bank system right,37
8050,Do it,5
8051,why don u believe me,20
8052,bru what,8
8053,i should be fine,16
8054,python,6
8055,i already know a few oop conecepts from,39
8056,bro what,8
8057,just go to,10
8058,biggest cap Ive ever heard,26
8059,no skidding ‚ùå,13
8060,i can prob learn these in like 3-4 hr if all i do is read docs and code,71
8061,then what üòé,11
8062,Just know basic C++,19
8063,Sure go for it,14
8064,so basically get sigma at oop conecpts?,39
8065,kk i can prob just read up,26
8066,Inherited classes only have access to public and protected,58
8067,Only protected,14
8068,nvm,3
8069,any link ?,10
8070,idk the cpp syntax for inheritance,34
8071,so any inherited class also has those methods right?,52
8072,private can be only accessed in that class or other friend classes,66
8073,but what afterwords,19
8074,+1 sigma point,14
8075,W FRFR,6
8076,Because you cant access it anywhere else,40
8077,AYE WAS I RIGHT?,16
8078,In that same class,18
8079,Make a function to return the private variable,46
8080,for setting and getting those,29
8081,getter setter or som?,21
8082,Yes what else,13
8083,they are pretty simular though,30
8084,"Ok exactly, other classes cant access it. You make it a private member. But you can make a function to access and return it in that same class",142
8085,like public restroom,20
8086,like coding keyword or actual public,36
8087,are u talking about public and private keywords,47
8088,no i wouldn't because people can access it,42
8089,so basically cash system using oop like a bank structure?,57
8090,am i supposed to answer,23
8091,Would you store a social security number publicly?,50
8092,"Learn how public, protected and private work",44
8093,Make a virtual bank using classes to start off with so you know how OOP works,77
8094,Learn basic shit,16
8095,No nigga,8
8096,somebody helppppppp!,20
8097,@sigma,6
8098,or send like 3298 docs,22
8099,i just need sigma teach to teach me up frfr,43
8100,üò≠  maybe not idk,16
8101,but even those detected i think,31
8102,me need 2 make new kernel driver,32
8103,but like why because read/write detcted üò¶,41
8104,my goal is to be a non skid roblox hecker,41
8105,should i start off learning winapi,34
8106,it doesnt mean anything,23
8107,because i dont like you,23
8108,i voted yes in ur retard vote,29
8109,its fast and easy,17
8110,C# is honestly pretty good for hobbyists,40
8111,C# is Microsoft Java lol,24
8112,yeah be a Zigma and use Zig,27
8113,C# gay either way,17
8114,you can just use ws2_32 or whatever thats called dll import to use it in C#,75
8115,like SOCK_STREAM for tcp?,25
8116,sockets,7
8117,if were talking about roblox,28
8118,websockets or normal sockets?,29
8119,might aswell use pipes or smth,30
8120,wouldnt wish that on anyone,27
8121,last i worked with sockets was in c++ and it was pain,53
8122,in usermode,11
8123,idk why but the documented version use -1 as process handle you just need to replace that with target process,109
8124,cus sockets is the fastest com method,37
8125,i dont code in C#,17
8126,uh idk,6
8127,not websockets,14
8128,Does C# not have sockets,24
8129,actually you only need one call to create a shared memory if you use an undocumented API,88
8130,untrue,6
8131,guys is this sigma tutorial,27
8132,internally is it not detected or what the sigma,47
8133,and wym its detected externally,31
8134,so basically u were tryna say user mode detected but kernel not or?,67
8135,user mode = virtual memory or osm idk and physical memory is like kernel lower level,84
8136,like maybe if u said like,25
8137,bro if you just explained better i woulda understanded,54
8138,you said the same exact thing üíÄ,31
8139,and cpp win api basics,22
8140,cpp basics,10
8141,C# basics,9
8142,my lawd,7

8149,hacking anything and computers,30
8150,do you know anything about programming?,39
8151,me  hacking journey,19
8152,started what yesterday,22
8153,what do you expect,18
8154,i started day b4yesterday,25
8155,and what would it be,20
8156,this guy is worse than the freaky russian guy,45
8157,why though,10
8158,he needs a new role,19
8159,please bro,10
8160,HEY RAM! WRITE THIS SHIT!,25
8161,kinda like how direct x,23
8162,ok ok,5
8163,yes i tell my ram directly to write to camera cframe for camlock,64
8164,virtual memory is like the addresses and bits in virtual world ?,64
8165,physical memory is ram irl right,32
8166,do you know how computers work,30
8167,lemme brain click,17
8168,please,6
8169,REAL LIFE MEMORY?,17
8170,WHAT IS PHYSICAL MEMORY,23
8171,VIRTUAL memory is DETECTED EXTERNALLY whereas PHYSICAL MEMORY isnt,66
8172,whats the new role gonna be,27
8173,bro this guy needs a new role,29
8174,reword so a three yr old can understand pls,43
8175,te sigma did you just say?,26
8176,virtual memory externally is detected where as physical isnt,60
8177,so only sigma anticheats or?,28
8178,as i know of,12
8179,roblox doesnt search your system for each driver to check if its signed or not,78
8180,kernel driver detected or som?,30
8181,bro üíÄ,5
8182,or*,3
8183,does byfron auto close if using unsigned kernel driver ro,57
8184,Nevermind,9
8185,na,2
8186,Does anyone know how to fix,27
8187,But it work on anything except roblox,37
8188,Even on other word,18
8189,On roblox,9
8190,Why my auto Ctrl click won't work,33
8191,not quitting SKULL_SKELETON,27
8192,Can someone help me,19
8193,he jus said he leaving the server,33
8194,u guys tweaking,15
8195,he said that?,13
8196,What injection method is the best for imgui,43
8197,Can someone,11
8198,or you hook shit,16
8199,game,4
8200,not LuaGc job,13
8201,you need to hook __namecall and __index,39
8202,?????????,9
8203,im hook LuaGc job,17
8204,you need to hook for this will work,35
8205,you aren't hook this,20

8238,Arman did,9
8239,I never did,11
8240,even arman agrees you're a larp,31
8241,now it all makes sense,22

8249,You don't know shit about VMValues other than how to get them and where to put them in the Luau source code,107
8250,dms?,4
8251,You can infer these. You can infer VMValues,43

8275,non manual mapper?,18
8276,just slightly less,18
8277,internals are also sigma,24
8278,externals are sigma,19
8279,Begging is crazy(I do that too),31
8280,aw nah,6
8281,"you were in my DMs begging me what function needs calling to inject a DLL, yet I'm the dumb one?",96
8282,Satisfying fr,13
8283,"Bytecode has to be interpreted, and this interpretation causes C++ code to run",78
8284,Let them fighting biscuit,25
8285,"No, you can absolutely write memory as well. If I change my walkspeed, I am not inherently triggering any code to run that otherwise wouldn't",141
8286,Mango mango mango skull face edit,33
8287,send proof pls me noob,22
8288,Externals absolutely do exist. You can have an external aimbot or ESP as those don't trigger roblox to run any code it otherwise wouldn't,137
8289,pretty sure it has a rat,24
8290,Bro is solara safe or not,25
8291,But I only use RPM/WPM,22
8292,all I did was write some bytes into memory,42
8293,how roblox decides to interpret said bytes does not matter,58
8294,"No, the DLL is just some bytes",30
8295,whos this huge group,20
8297,there is no set in stone rule i dont think these 2 just have conflicting opinions,81
8298,sigma üòé,7
8299,everyone has their own definition,33
8300,ü§Ø,1
8301,bro isnt it internal because your injecting the code into luau vm or som,72
8302,I'm not gonna discuss anything with someone who's already decided they're right,79
8303,oh so luau doesnt matter,24
8304,meaning that actual C++ code is ran,35
8305,"At a shallow level, this code is sent off to the Luau VM, which then runs different C++ code stubs for every instruction",120
8306,what does luau compile to,25
8307,Woops 2 smart people are fighting aight,39
8308,im in the peb and detected am i internal üî•,42
8309,You literally are internal. You officially have your own custom code running *inside* the Roblox process,104
8310,How do you think a VM runs code???,34
8311,I only have color bot rnüòî,25
8312,You are actually retarded,25
8313,external = i did not write into roblox\ninternal = i did\n(?),61
8314,Can someone give me humanoid address offset I'll pay,52
8315,You can write a fully external aimbot/ESP by just reading properties,68
8316,"No, because this does not write any code that's ran internally by Roblox",72
8317,Solara is both external and internal,36
8318,Solara is a hybrid at best,26
8319,"You send a script from the external Solara UI into the internally runing init script, which then runs the script. What about this screams external to you?",154
8320,so i get,8
8321,no cuz you told me to get all vmvaules,38
8322,waht,4
8323,KeAcquireInterruptSpinLock :: 00007,35
8324,what on earth is a spinlock,27
8325,holy shit y'all are skids,25
8326,oh ye thought this was common knowledge,39
8327,look what i am sending,22
8328,oh yeah,7
8329,are you actually retarded,25
8330,"so if I overwrite shellcode instead of injecting it, I'm external?",66
8331,hello agument,13
8332,it injects bytecode,19
8333,you can't do execution externally,33
8334,kk good idea,12
8335,It sorta is,11
8336,dms,3
8337,check,5
8338,lovre,5
8339,So like I have something to aim at,34
8340,I'll try to create one for dahhood then I'll just modify the model on Roblox files,82
8341,Having your own Luau state does not make you internal,53
8342,just check dms,14
8343,pydirectinput move n stuff just check docs,42
8344,pydirectinput is pretty easy\nit has functions such as,54
8345,pyautogui and pydirectinput,27
8346,Okay man ty,11
8347,You might actually be autistic,30
8348,actually i think py direct input is better,42
8350,For like universal,18
8351,How do I create one for aimbot where can I buy like offset dumper for humanoid address,86
8352,ready *,7
8353,lemme try and remember other one..,34
8354,Okay bro ty,11
8355,"keyboard, pyautogui and errr",28
8356,you have shuffle6?,18
8357,but lovre,9
8358,as a wise man once said:,24
8359,idc about skids here,20
8360,Do u have any modules that will be usedul,41
8361,"Replacing the bytecode of a script to then have your own bytecode ran is, by definition injection.",98
8362,Okay bro ty man,15
8363,just get the head color or in arsenal set the edge to highlighted(in arsenal settings),86
8364,How to add colors to Roblox character,37
8365,Ty bro,6
8366,But injecting a Luau script into the game is still external? Even though that Luau script causes the Luau VM to call a plethora of functions it otherwise wouldn't?,163
8367,I'll try,8
8368,Oooooo okay,11
8369,undetected,10
8370,make 1 in python frfr color bot frfrfr,38
8371,Bc I wanna create aimbot:>,26
8372,Can someone tell me a very good injection method,48
8373,:<,2
8374,next update is patched,22
8375,Now I'll skid it's injection method,35
8376,Aight tyty,10
8377,and next update idk,19
8378,wintrustverifly,15
8379,Ud?,3
8380,setwindowhookex,15
8381,There have been plenty of threadless shellcode injection methods leaked,71
8382,What injection method does synapse z use,40
8383,OOOOOOO,7
8384,I can replace the code of print and just start a recording in roblox,68
8385,Inject dll is internwl,22
8386,His wrong here at this point,28
8387,gonna calm down frfrfr,22
8388,You can't call this external if you inject dll.,47
8389,"So if I replace the code of the internal print function, and trigger a print, my cheat is still external?",105
8390,Why people here is always smarter than me manüò≠,46
8391,my history frfr,15
8392,No injection real,17
8393,show us your history,20
8394,His actually right man,22
8395,You cannot do execution fully externally,40
8396,Your entire argument is flawed,30
8397,"So if I write an executor that injects a DLL, but I call it external, it would be external? Because how can I, the creator of my own softwrare get the terminology wrong",168
8398,If it's external u cant do shit with the game,45
8399,Wait bro he actually prove a point man,38
8400,He literally got the terminology wrong,38
8401,make common sense,17
8402,It does.,8
8403,I thought external doesn't touch the game,41
8404,wow TheMoon learned the difference we are doomed,48
8405,"Exactly. So when Solara replaces the bytecode of a script with their own inti script, that init script is ran by Roblox *internally*",132
8406,Wait aren't solara both external and internal,45
8407,"Internal=DLL inject\nExternal=Esp + AimBot, Lua execute",55
8408,"You don't seem to, though",25
8409,ü§∑,1
8410,you can also to see on source code,34
8411,they need bridge for change some for this will execute and shit,63
8412,It's really hard man,20
8413,"If Solara is fully external, why would it need a bridge? Could it be because you need a bridge to interact from an external part to an internal aprt?",149
8414,Idk how to bypass Roblox security,33
8415,I tried making a backdoor before it's really hard,49
8416,bridge yk what is this?,23
8417,thanks for the explenation,26
8418,not luau,8
8419,So the init script which is ran by the internal Luau VM is external?,68
8420,and they use lua,16
8421,roblox use lua,14
8422,right? cuz this doesn't matter?,31
8423,they explicitly want you to not capitilize it,45
8424,"You said ""LUA""",14
8425,lol?,4
8426,Luau->lua,9
8427,The internal part,17
8428,"""DLL""",5
8429,Don't capitilize Lua,20
8430,or smth else.,13
8431,this replace bytecode of script that they choose (code empty) and just change to their bytecode LUA with the thing (i forgot the name) and use websocket,152
8432,"just because Solara does not inject a DLL, doesn't mean it's external",69
8433,I'm just using that as an example,33
8434,I know,6
8435,"So if I write an executor that doesn't inject a DLL, rather injects shellcode that calls the functions needed for execution, that executor would be external?",157
8436,You cannot do external execution,32
8437,solara works by replacing the bytecode of a script. It's essentially DLL injection except your DLL is written in Luau and is limited to level 3.,144
8438,solara is external,18
8439,they tryna cook me up,21
8440,xeno is external,16
8441,i went on other site called solara . something,46
8442,okokoko good,12
8443,anyways i am going to get 3-9 shuffles,38
8444,"""external"" then it isn't even external",38
8445,dawg ok,7
8446,send link plsslpsls,19
8447,some skid on v3rm is posting the source code,44
8448,isn't xeno priavte?,19
8449,check yourself,14
8450,is xeno fake unc ? üíÄ,20
8451,idc,3
8452,ok xeno then,12
8453,do they show the source,23
8454,solara is ratted,16
8455,how do you know if its not ratted,33
8456,i thought solara was ratted,27
8457,but it only has like 60% UNC,28
8458,solara,6
8459,and free,8
8460,that actually have non faked unc,32
8461,any  executors,14
8462,"he's unteachable, don't bother",30
8463,"""you can reference a list and get the remaining ones""",53
8464,knowing global and typesize allows you to infer all the other vmvalues,70
8465,I'm not gonna explain it again,30
8466,and lua_newthread work for you.,31
8467,global_State and typeinfo,25
8468,when you only call 2 vmalues,28
8469,i dont understand,17
8470,that's your issue,17
8471,"you know how to get vmvalues, but you don't fully understand them",65
8472,Can someone tell me what's harder to make normal exploit or backdoor serverside,79
8473,Nah Hyperion v5 is smart,24
8474,you arent hook this,19
8475,"bruh, why is this happening",27
8476,is smart,8
8477,cuz they smart,14
8478,100% success no ban,19
8479,Good saveinstance,17
8480,Very secure exploit,19
8481,well i know to get all vmvaules but still dont got how this work for you,72
8482,Bc it has 99% snc 99% unc 99% unc,33
8483,Why synapse z is the best exploit,33
8484,Look back on previous combinations of vmvalues and you'll see a pattern,71
8485,"My point is, you only need to know these two to know the rest",61
8486,Tell me too man ü•π,17
8487,Tell me too bc it's hard,24
8488,this crash for me,17
8489,global_State and the typesize,29
8490,cuz when i used the,19
8491,kinda werid,11
8492,erm.,4
8493,I don't want skids to know this,31
8494,It's bad as f,13
8495,I can explain in DMs if you want,32
8496,Why byte code swapping,22
8497,"No. You only need two vmvalues, and using those two vmvalues, you can reference a list and get the remaining ones",113
8498,you mean you *update* them.,27
8499,Y'all just gonna ignore me bruhü•π,32
8500,I have full Luau,16
8501,then you dont have access to lua_newthread and shit,51
8502,It's what my dumper does,24
8503,nigga what?,11
8504,Then you know the rest,22
8505,Then add fake function thanking it will be better than other edploit,68
8506,No you need global and typesize,31
8507,Why every free exploit use the shittiest execution method or injection method,77
8508,that i need tname and ttname?,29
8509,so you want to tell me,22
8510,"what about TABLE, UDATA, PROTO, CLOSURE?",40
8511,You just don't know enough about vmvalues,41
8512,How much,8
8513,Not wrong,9
8514,:skid,5
8515,Literally,9
8516,All you need is 2 vmvalues and you can infer the rest,53
8517,shuffles and vmvalues is easy,29
8518,Why buy shuffles and vmvalues,29
8519,How much?,9
8520,someone that sell to you shuffles and vmvalues,46
8521,Who's that,10
8522,shuffles and vmvalues,21
8523,I'll just buy exploit attm this point,37
8524,or buy from @Aramn that he isn't here,37
8525,Ik them bru I'm not pure skid,29
8526,unless to skid,14
8527,I rather buy exploit ngl,24
8528,I doubt you even know what those are,36
8529,XDD,3
8530,Yah,3
8531,Yeah but you'd still have to get shuffles and vmvalues every update,67
8532,Reverse engineer Roblox add functions and tada,46
8533,Thats what I'm saying skid something modified it,48
8534,Nobody is gonna feed you a 100% UNC executor,44
8535,I sunc it they all 40%,22
8536,Not xeno,8
8537,No like I meant real unc that what I will skid,46
8538,Like 95% UNC of which 50% is fake but who cares,47
8539,Literally just skid ballistic,29
8540,But nah I rather skid that I can turn into my private exploit than work hard,76
8541,ü•π,1
8542,they can to put some rat on files,33
8543,That's what I'm saying,22
8544,Except those xeno type injection nah even if u skid It will not be worth it,75
8545,Why not just modified it,24
8546,skid source code not good idea,30
8547,also.,5
8548,and im sure that you skid anything,34
8549,cuz maybe this will teach some?,31
8550,2020,4
8551,Why would I work hard for something that will probably not worth it,67
8552,20+20=?,7
8553,sorry to say,12
8554,biggest shit i ever heard ngl.,30
8555,Yeah If I found a actually good to skid and I can just add unc function and sunc function then I rather do that than work whole my month frfr,141
8556,r u sigma,9
8557,^^ average skid,15
8558,Or whatever else it may be you're writing,41
8559,It really doesn't matter unless you plan on releasing your executor,67
8560,"I personally don't use any code that isn't mine, but I browse open sources to see how other people implement various functions",126
8561,To some extent at least,23
8562,Skidding? More or less everyone,31
8563,i want to know who doing this üíî,31
8564,So your executor will also suck,31
8565,"You can skid all you want, but every source out there right now sucks",69
8566,Hm alright if you say so bluehumbsup,36
8567,stopping fighting skidding is the way,37
8568,"simple, fast, and easy",22
8569,"like if you really have no clue what you're doing, you can always just use a file for IPC",89
8570,webserver for IPC is overkill,29
8571,gives you a buffer you can read from and write to,49
8572,two function calls on the internal and external,47
8573,on windows all you have to do is map a file in memory,53
8574,u can just use shared memory as IPC,35
8575,ye i was abt to say,19
8576,What is thus,12
8577,ima drop this here so I dont forget,35
8578,"named pipe, shared memory, RPC",30
8579,oh right i forgot about getaddress,34
8580,ig you dont got me,18
8581,with localhost,14
8582,I just can to use for myself eg_dnc,35
8583,"Well your choose, if you prefer to execute from WEB as krampus so ye.",69
8584,scripts*,8
8585,"I wonder what is best to use, to use C# to execute or to use websocket and all stuff to execute",95
8586,I said,6
8587,What,4
8588,or with websocket and stuff,27
8589,With C# to execute,18
8590,Also i wonder what better to make executer,42
8591,eg_dnc,6
8592,And dump with x64dbg suspened thread,36
8593,you can to do some,18
8594,Well.,5
8595,roblox globals,14
8596,lua globals,11
8597,by calling instance methods,27
8598,what how,8
8599,lmfao,5
8600,this is literally one of the shittiest methods,46
8601,enumproto was hot ass,21
8602,I do use another function now tho,33
8603,Then don't,10
8604,personally,10
8605,I still would never use luavm::load,35
8606,This chunk of code is always present,36
8607,I have a game I use for dumping,31
8608,I don't dump with Gogo's,24
8609,and ur dump will also change,28
8610,Cus the func is so big and it changes,37
8611,its just bad lol,16
8612,So hard,7
8613,Wowie all the needed offsets in 10loc,37
8614,Nikeneutral,11
8615,that was sarcastic,18
8616,:3 (i already got),18
8617,gud englis,10
8618,i can just get the stuck and stuck last and ci and global from where vmvaules are,81
8619,(its already patched in the next hyperion version),50
8620,(it will be),12
8621,so dumps are different,22
8622,especially once dumping with gogo's gets patched,48
8623,its harder than other ways,26
8624,right but this so much easy,27
8625,theres faster ways,18
8626,why bother using it,19
8627,luavm::load is always bad,25
8628,very bad,8
8629,Nah uh,6
8630,telling the skids the hardest methods,37

8696,Yep,3
8697,what is this attack omgggfewef,30
8698,It was used in a BYOVD attack recently,38
8699,why its better,14
8700,it's a vulnerable driver that allows you to write to any memory address,71
8701,to the pen,10
8702,to the ring0,12
8703,from the screen,15
8704,what is winring0,16
8705,bruh shutup go make WinRing0 exploits or something,50
8706,idk why i decided to fix it tho,31
8707,no im pro with fixed cheat engine injector for teleporters,58
8708,no ur gay,9
8709,=,1
8710,joining a init place,20
8711,nah I can click leave go to home page and join any game,55
8712,wooooow,7
8713,so teleporter,13
8714,it needs init place tho,23
8715,and definitely not a lie,24
8716,so pro method,13
8717,changing bytecode is skid method very detected,46
8718,secret bitch,12
8719,then what u do,14
8720,I don't change bytecode,23
8721,very easily,11
8722,after changing bytecode,23
8723,u are detected,14
8724,readprocessmemory detected,26
8725,changing bytecode,17
8726,better than an internal creampie,32
8727,yeah and it's less detectable,29
8728,for 3 updates straight if i remember correctly,46
8729,not even changing offsets,25
8730,ur external,11
8731,i update externals in 1 second,30
8732,mod drop already updated,24

8747,starting from 0 identity luavm load,35
8748,it's for class cache for getting class name,43
8749,should i try create pro internal exec without using shuffles and encryptions,76
8750,why someone even needs it,25
8751,It's scriptcontextvftable,25

8916,?!?!?,5
8917,you dont have to specify +,26
8918,a offset is an increment from an address nigga,46
8919,im obviously joking nigga,25
8920,cuz the original one is gone,28

8973,like uintptr,12
8974,identity and script should be an unsigned 8 byte type,53
8975,read it,7
8976,you need scriptctx + the offset,31
8977,am i supposed to get lua state without globalstate to get waitinghybridscriptsjob first,87
8978,i do exactly like this,22
8979,some shit like that,19
8980,"getluastate(scriptctx + offset, &identity, &script)\n\ndecryptedstate((lua_State*)luastate)",91
8981,wrong or no,11
8982,so i dont need to,17
8983,noob he said its still the same,31
8984,hey dumbass if you jump to the xref calling the func it gives you the offset in dec,83
8985,is it wrong,11
8986,then i decrypt it by decrypt luastate + decryptstate,52
8987,i encrypt state by getting waitinghybridscriptsjob + scriptcontextjob + scriptcontextstate,90
8988,fix code,8

9237,after a few seconds,19
9238,though now you also have to remove the hook on winverifytrust after you do it because it trigger the integrity check,116
9239,REAL!,5
9240,swhx still works if you remap it back to write execute,54
9241,isnt the normal injection methods patched too?,46

9304,Sob,3
9305,does vpex not change the proteciton of something/,49
9306,by saying virtual protect ex to change protection,49
9307,on a specific subject,21
9308,how am i retarded besidese me not being sure,44

9320,people use,10
9321,isnt that the thingy thingy,27
9322,imma try smth else,18

9336,from svchost,12
9337,I remember people used to steal it,34
9338,Oh I see,8
9339,ntdll,5
9340,(actually 100 but taxes took 30 from it),40
9341,also i won 70 robux!1!1!1!,26
9342,virtual protect ex to change protection,39
9343,and i can read,14
9344,what u said is stupid,21
9345,where u can steal the handle from,33
9346,it was svchost,14
9347,oh wait nah,11
9348,Idk if that was the one,23
9349,csrss?,6
9350,that runs,9
9351,the one windows service,23
9352,from whats it called,20
9353,the one that started with a 1,29
9354,i hijack my handle,18
9355,not special or anything,23
9356,is hijack,9
9357,but a think i probably do different from different swhx injectors,65
9358,well not only,13
9359,shouldnt be,11
9360,type it properly,16
9361,how to,6
9362,or was,6
9363,I am,4
9364,atleast my decomp gonna be finished,35
9365,oh shit i left ida running,26
9366,"im not home currently, will check later",39
9367,/ what asm instructions,23
9368,What kind of byte patch ru using,32
9369,But you should,14
9370,Dunno,5
9371,angry face bro,14
9372,I DO NOT GET IT,15
9373,dude why dont i crash on the unreleased version then,52
9374,lowkeyly,8
9375,AKA check for shitters,22
9376,Now,3
9377,DLL,3
9378,In both wintrust and crypt,26
9379,They have a integrity check,27
9380,/shrig,6
9381,I never looked into it but I figured they'd do something as fundamental as that,79
9382,Neither are threads,19
9383,It would work,13
9384,and the protection got changed,30
9385,Oh?,3
9386,assuming ur read isnt fucked,28
9387,Uhhhh,5
9388,(That isn‚Äôt used as a detection vector),39
9389,and... silence!1!11!,20
9390,"u saying that this noob is not so dumb when he literally says ""virtual protect winverifytrust and pro fixed""",108
9391,also i know nigga,17
9392,i can get some offsets in ida cuz i learned,43
9393,alao,4
9394,i didnt bought yet,18
9395,how i was dumb then nigger,26
9396,but for me u did all the work,29
9397,retard vote for him when,24
9398,so hot,6
9399,Its gonna be so good,20
9400,And,3
9401,im ognna leak my injector source,32
9402,CALL ME DADDY WHORE,19
9403,IM THE BEST TO TOUCH THIS EARTH,31
9404,EXACTLY,7
9405,YOU FUCKING IMBECILE CUNT,25
9406,S,1
9407,E,1
9408,Y,1
9409,dot dot...,10
9410,ironic,6
9411,thats why,9
9412,( lie ),7
9413,Ironically smarterest bestest person here,41
9414,Im,2
9415,Faggot I'm not like You,23
9416,I did,5
9417,so it works for everybody,25
9418,this is the same as free library,32
9419,everyone does,13
9420,and the injector was leaked anyways so ofc u have the injector fuck nigga,73
9421,seeing ur name,14
9422,i dont remember,15
9423,Oh really?,10
9424,u were not,10
9425,and spamming inject,19
9426,with change permission,22
9427,this just manual mapping,24
9428,Rune=Vision,11
9429,i have Rune injector cuz i was one of dev,41
9430,"you have to also unnmapview, createsection and map back",55
9431,its more complicated than that,30
9432,you just change permission,26
9433,so i can set it to execute_writecopy,36
9434,i just remap wintrust from mem_physical,39
9435,"Just use poolparty, it's not that difficult",43
9436,then what oding men,19
9437,i don't virtual protect,23
9438,im 9999% sure,13
9439,or i may be wrong but,21
9440,virtual protect exxxxxx right?,30
9441,swhx is as stable as it gets,28
9442,it works there aswell,21
9443,you can see the ss before,25
9444,and unreleased build?,21
9445,sometimes i was crash,21
9446,wdym no,7
9447,tehnically the best method is to manually map and whitelist a memory region (rwx),81
9448,thats because these methods aren't very good to use,51
9449,well ik that one too,20
9450,on swhx you randomly crash,26
9451,though that could've been something else,40
9452,"well i wouldn't recommend remapping anyway, in my testing i found out that there is something weird going on when you remap and you can just  randomly crash",156
9453,well i mean you right but,25
9454,"In a month's time, someone will have already leaked an injector anyway",70
9455,There's a dozen ways to inject,30
9456,skids want,10
9457,Injectors aren't anything special,33
9458,keep save private,17
9459,and leak,8
9460,dont let skids paste,20
9461,it would be funny if i posted it here,37
9462,where your proof then,21
9463,"""in under 2 mins lmao""",22
9464,didn't you said,15
9465,send,4
9466,its also in the synapse repo i think,36
9467,XD,2
9468,he prob skidded this,20
9469,for remap,9
9470,for what,8
9471,i got the code from some russian guy,36
9472,hijack handle,13
9473,u js remap whole mem region,27
9474,thats fine though cause it works,32
9475,and it triggered integrity,26
9476,oh i forgot to unload dll,25
9477,check on build verison,22
9478,cause it remaps the entire region to rw,39
9479,also it should work on latest anyway,36
9480,on current ver,14
9481,try on build verison,20
9482,i didn't see that on the server i check for these,49
9483,there a push,12
9484,from what i know,16
9485,and thats latest version,24
9486,its b7,6
9487,join to General,15
9488,seem look like not a new verison,32
9489,though you can't keep the dll loaded in for long cause you have to unhook winverifytrust or the integrity check crashes you after some time,139
9490,ima write an injector in like an hour or so,43
9491,swhx still?,11
9492,EZPZ,4
9493,or do what woffle said and just create a page internally through one threadpool and then use that rwx page you created to run your manual mapped dll from a second threadpool,173
9494,yeah but you still need a page whitelisted with rwx,51
9495,u can just use threadpool,25
9496,Yh we have the other invasive methods‚Ñ¢Ô∏è,39
9497,"best method is FreeLibrary(GetModuleHandleA(""""));",49
9498,Thats detectable af its not even worth it anymore,49
9499,just dont use wintrust at all!,30
9500,oooooooor,9
9501,"or you can just remap, patch, load, unpatch",43
9502,Just remap it bro trust,23
9503,though they still have integrity check so you would have to bypass that aswell,78
9504,easy fix,8
9505,still,5
9506,Indeed,6
9507,back to normal mem,18
9508,you can remap,13
9509,Try writing to mem_physical on um lil bro,41
9510,They remapped to mem_physical,29
9511,Are u retarded,14
9512,probably doesnt work,20
9513,You can't just virtual protect,30
9514,"Does that even work, If they remap to mem_ whatever it was",58
9515,i have some methods,19
9516,i dont need to,14
9517,issue,5
9518,change page protection and ur,29
9519,skidding anything,17
9520,your,4
9521,üî• writing,9
9522,Chinese version üò≠,17
9523,yes they retarded,17
9524,so i can talk shit,18
9525,im pushing a solid 3,20
9526,have 0 braincells,17
9527,in this server,14
9528,i swear niggas,14
9529,USE VIRTUAL PROTECT EX TO CHANGE THE PROTECTION,47
9530,then bypass and show,20
9531,that you can bypass,19
9532,if you say,10
9533,only a couple mem regions are RX,32
9534,nigga you can't bypass while winveriflytrust is read and execute,64
9535,retarded ahh,12
9536,nigga u can bypass,18
9537,"""unpatch"" üò≠",11
9538,this changed to read and execute,32
9539,nigga?,6
9540,you can lit unpatch winverifytrust method in under 2 mins lmao,62
9541,Nothing prevents you from writing an internal manual mapper and tp-ing it,73
9542,"And iirc, any memory created from within Roblox gets whitelisted so it can have rwx",83
9543,You have enough time from your allocation to byfrons permissions change to run any shellcode,92
9544,(hehe heh),10
9545,on TP you need shellcode,24
9546,tbh,3
9547,So winverifytrust isn't called on it,36
9548,Obv,3
9549,Then the DLL doesn't show up in the processes DLL list,54
9550,i forgot what one im on,23
9551,try  or something,17
9552,you‚Äôre probably on an unsupported version,41
9553,i used this for old verison,27
9554,WinVerifyTrust is patched.. so need to update,45
9555,i already have manunal with shwx,32
9556,No but this easy to make maunul map with tp,43
9557,Just use threadpool,19
9558,my injection still gonna be working,35
9559,üíÄ I'm chilling,14
9560,and also im probably fucked once roblox gonna update,52
9561,nigga 5 am,10
9562,or i will continue using xeno since its easier,46
9563,then i gonna pay maybe,22
9564,if im not gonna learn,21
9565,just to try learn,17
9566,without them,12
9567,so i started my own,19
9568,ballistic needs shuffles with encryptions,41
9569,my own,6
9570,what pasted executr are u trying to use,39
9571,im tired of restarting my pc,28
9572,nigga everytime when im crashing and trying to open roblox again it wont start,78
9574,thanks bro,10
9575,not 3 numbers,13
9576,if its a library its always gonna return the rbg color,54
9577,it will,7
9578,im gonna kms,12
9579,if that works,13
9580,"game:GetService(""Lighting"").Ambient = v",39
9581,/Ààv…ôrCH(…ôw)…ôl//pr…ôÀàtek(t)//eks/,31
9582,VirtualProtectEx..,18
9583,thats how ui libs work,22
9584,Bye,3
9585,ok ur retarded,14
9586,selected as,11
9587,v is what the color picker will be,34
9588,its from ui lib so,18
9589,what is v,9
9590,i mean i assumed that i am but i dont see how,45
9591,u are retarded,14
9593,That's very skiddy behaviour,28
9594,Now its patched and you're lost,31
9595,Your cheat depended on swhx,27
9596,You've been using a leaked injection method because you couldn't figure it out yourself?,88
9597,So you're a skid?,17
9598,so I can download a few pdbs,28
9599,pdb,3
9600,a robloxplayerbeta,18
9601,cus why would it have,21
9602,where it actually shows u,25
9603,from what I know,16
9604,but theres a better site,24
9605,a pdb,5
9606,if It cant find,15
9607,it says,7
9608,probably in the output console,30
9609,Won't be getting on until tomorrow,34
9610,Well I'm in bed rn so,21
9611,Oh bruh,7
9612,I think I disabled automatically checking for pdb,49
9613,It did for me,13
9614,TP works fine,13
9615,Just open IDA and it'll tell you,32
9616,Idk the address,15
9617,a few pdbs,10
9618,I needa download,16
9619,Yh Ida has told me,18
9620,for stuff like,14
9621,to get their symbol files / .pdb,32
9622,Do yk the microsoft site,24
9623,Or just don't inject a DLL at all and just use threadpool to do your function calls,83
9624,Or use one of the dozen leaked shellcode injection method,57
9625,Like it's that easy,19
9626,Seriously just manually map your DLL and threadpool dllmain,59
9627,It can't be that difficult to bypass it üíî,41
9628,They probably have an integrity check on the whole dll tho,58
9629,checking rn if it works or not,30
9630,I used an old way like 8 months ago,35
9631,to use it,9
9632,SetThreadContext is one way but you probably dont have a bypass,63
9633,without hooking it,18
9634,how would u spoof the reutrn,28
9635,???????,7
9636,cus I use LoadLibraryA,22
9637,so my dll even loads,20
9638,I hook WinVerifyTrust,21
9639,I just dont know if they check the whole wintrust dll now though,64
9640,that works as good,18
9641,I can probably find another func to hook,40
9642,My own one yes,14
9643,cus of winverifytrust,21
9644,now it doesnt work anymore though,33
9645,thats what I was doing before,29
9646,I just edited source,20
9647,look that up,12
9648,PoolParty,9
9649,Should,6
9650,Iirc,4
9651,You just gotta swap out crt with tp,35
9652,Ik i have it,12
9653,where most of it works,22
9654,theres one in a specific,24
9655,they do,7
9656,celery skidded one,18
9657,There are plenty of open source mappers,39
9658,Just map ur dll and tp dllmain,30
9659,but cba,7
9660,thats one way,13
9661,Manually map,12
9662,way,3
9663,either,6
9664,or youll crash,14
9665,u gotta hook winverifytrust,27
9666,to use TP,9
9667,Shit time to fix my IC injector then,36
9668,Yes...,6
9669,Real?,5
9670,someoen put me onn,18
9671,thats patched,13
9672,Ye threadpools go hard,22
9673,someone give me the game method,31
9674,I'm glad they patched it cuz now yoru won't release a shitsploit,64
9675,I was using thread pools,24
9676,can still inject but I crash after a few seconds,48
9677,"There are plenty of ways to inject, we don't need swhx",54
9678,xor eax eax,11
9679,"like mov eax, 0",15
9680,tried multiple ways,19
9681,That sucks üíî,12
9682,if I write to it,16
9683,everytime,9
9684,I crash after almost around 8s,30
9685,it seems like,13
9686,they have an integrity check now,32
9687,Even if you write to WinVerifyTrust,35
9688,And after this dump + decrypt,29
9689,Just try to inject,18
9690,Just find way to dump,21
9691,Nigga,5
9692,as i can see,12
9693,wow roblox patching shits,25
9694,gg switching to dumping on runtime again,40
9695,got the same,12
9696,with his game,13
9697,decrypted,9
9698,I think almost 9k pages,23
9699,GRH gets like,13
9700,instance*,9
9701,and isntance methods,20
9702,lua / roblox funcs,18
9703,calling all,11
9704,Goes hard ngl,13
9705,game method,11
9706,do u still use,14
9707,I don't use it,14
9708,That doesn't matter for me,26
9709,Decryptor patched too I think,29
9710,I already have another injection method lmfao,45
9711,for injection it could be less or more,38
9712,for general use it's 20 lines to write,38
9713,Not for injection,17
9714,wait no,7
9715,Both,4
9716,it's documented so it's easy,28
9717,Threadpooling is only 20 lines,30
9718,That's funny,12
9719,Finally üôèüôèüôè,11
9720,You can just write a tp injector,32
9721,I'll get to it tomorrow,23
9722,they remap it,13
9723,WinVerifyTrust is Read + Execute only,37
9724,New roblox update,17
9725,That's how long it takes to write an executor from scratch,58
9726,My latest projects first git commit was 5 days ago,50
9727,How long can it fucking take to write an executor,49
9728,He's been working on it for a whole ass year now,48
9729,"If he was anywhere near as competent as he thinks he is, headhunter would've been out ages ago",94
9730,And calls it a feature,22
9731,So he has to hide it behind this shitty toolbar,47
9732,But his executor is incapable of doing anything impressive,58
9733,Those features just run small scripts,37
9734,He does execute,15
9735,"seriously, how do people have any respect for this guy",54
9736,how could fishy write an executor in C++ when he only knew python and batch?,76
9737,what's this? headhunter was developed all the way back in 2022?,63
9738,"christmas day of 2023, he only knew python and batch",52
9739,and another thing relating to headhunter,40
9740,wowie,5
9741,"besides, I wouldn't use anything written by someone who claims python is a low level language",93
9742,I'm willing to bet that behind all of this is just a lvl3 shitsploit that communicates with the DLL through a webserver or something shitty like that,149
9743,funny how this shit released around the same time swhx was leaked,65
9744,wow literally claims it's detected,34
9745,^^ he is charging money for this,32
9746,"and now he's working on ""headhunter v4"", which spoiler alert, is never releasing",80
9747,he spent a year working on a cheat that's less powerful than lvl3 shitsploits,77
9748,fishy is one of the biggest larps in the community,50
9749,reeks of skidding,17
9750,I wouldn't use anything fishy made,34
9751,Ive just showed u a pic,23
9752,but the xref is in luavm::load,30
9753,Then dont care,14
9754,I can see that xref,19
9755,like grh,8
9756,u gotta make a dump beautifier,30
9757,wont let you see specific,25
9758,just using gogos / fishys modified version,42
9759,ur dump is just shitty,22
9760,shitty dump btw,15
9761,because funcs r inlined,23
9762,theres strings in luavm::load,29
9763,"""nigga i dont think theres any strings in it""",45
9764,thats why its inside of luavm::load,35
9765,u fucktard,10
9766,that xref is in luavm::load,27
9767,(because its inlined),21
9768,(why do you think its in luavm::load),37
9769,from what I remember,20
9770,the second and third are switched,33
9771,the arguments r changed,23
9772,This easy asf üò≠,15
9773,Damn,4
9774,is hard,7
9775,yea thats just getting them correctly,37
9776,Absolute goldmine for vmvalues,30
9777,"Roblox includes the """" file or wtv it's called",46
9778,Most of them are trivial,24
9779,i dont know how to find them,28
9780,You only really need the closure and proto related ones,55
9781,I still use luavm load i dont got all vmvalues might switch later on,68
9782,I mean yea both works,21
9783,Since you don't need to decompress the bytecode of the script,61
9784,I find the internal lvm load to be convenient for getscriptclosure,66
9785,Do whatever you want,20
9786,also luau_load has one more parameter right?,44
9787,i mean if your getting all shuffles and vmvalues anyways which you need for working capabilites and unc might as well,117
9788,"You need bytecode decompression anyway if you want UNC, meaning you need zstd and xxhash, so you're gonna have a compression function anyway",140
9789,with luau_load,14
9790,yes but you dont need to compress bytecode,42
9791,luavm::load calls luau_load,27
9792,"There's no ""more stability""",27
9793,idk if you can do an env in luavm load though,45
9794,If you have all shuffles and vmvalues which you need anyways you might as well use luau_load more stability,107
9795,Real quickkkkkkkkkkkkk,22
9796,psuedo code,11
9797,script start,12
9798,can someone send me,19
9799,Look!,5
9800,okay!,5
9801,im going based off what i was told i havent even looked at luau‚Äôs source,72
9802,he said it so it must be true,29
9803,luau_load is deprecated though,30
9804,woah,4
9805,Crazy how luavm::load calls luau_load,37
9806,ok im using luavm::load since its modernized,44
9807,how does that answer my question,32
9808,do you know what github is,26
9809,did you hit your head on a pole,31
9810,luavm::load or luau_load,24
9811,which should i use,18
9812,what is better for execution,28
9813,dont leak these secrets,23
9814,what the fuck is there to get confused on,41
9815,so is roblox,12
9816,nigga no its not üò≠,18
9817,print is also deprecated,24
9818,what üò≠,6
9819,ik luau_load is deprecated,26
9820,luau_load,9
9821,luavm::load,11
9822,which is more powerful,22
9823,im confused,11
9824,now it double pritns tho but ez fix,35
9826,dms btw,7
9827,I have an idea for most VMValues,32
9828,cus ur gonna have to check a bunch of stuff,43
9829,Ye the last part is tedious,27
9830,ye that's what I'm gonna do,27
9831,it just tried all 4 vmvalues and then checked the result,56
9832,by just using structs,21
9833,ru gonna do it the same way,27
9834,Mine required vmvalues,22
9835,one of these days...,20
9836,I'm gonna write one,19
9837,might aswell make a dumper now,30
9838,I just made a lua script to make signatures,43
9839,oh well,7
9840,ioh my god,10
9841,this nigga shit,15
9842,is it grabbing,14
9843,why the fuck,12
9844,dead,4
9845,Wanted to make a vmvalue bruteforcer ages ago but too lazy,58
9846,ida plugin,10
9847,programitcallyl oyor whatever it is,35
9848,i mean manually,15
9849,im doing what you do to get it automatically,44
9850,that change alot,16
9851,not using sigs,14
9852,for big funcs,13
9853,Signatures are unreliable,25
9854,im trying to maek a dumper nigga,32
9855,get it manually? lol,20
9856,yes but i dont wanna implement a xref descrambler for 1 address,63
9857,is inside of luavm::load,24
9858,bytecode version mismatch,25
9859,to see what i did wrong,23
9860,now i have to go back like 999 versions,39
9861,it got fyucked up,17
9862,thanks for telling bro,22
9863,thats not even lvm load,23
9864,oh shit,7
9865,GetScheduler function in 2024 üò≠,31
9866,man fuck this shit im doing this tommorow,41
9867,scriptcontext name,18
9868,why can i not get,17
9869,brrrrrrrrrrro,13
9870,idk if there is other methods to decrypt lua state,50
9871,based on ballistic it already uses shuffles with encryptions for decrypting lua state,85
9872,new printsploit has been made,29
9873,Fallllllllllllllllllllllse bro i can call print,47
9874,u cant do nun,13
9875,nigga without it,16
9876,prioritizing,12
9877,am,2
9878,encryptions,11
9879,shuffles,8
9880,cause im not getting these manually fucdk nigga,47
9881,most important is shuffles with encryptions,43
9882,you do something better then nigga,34
9883,like 3 days ago,15
9884,i have started this,19
9885,nigga its not finished,22
9886,dump shuffles with encryptions,30
9887,next is scriptcontext name  and scriptcontextstate,50
9888,but i havent added a majority of what i am trying to add,56
9890,get out,7
9891,im mockingy,11
9892,wat noob,8
9893,its not a public dumper BUT its not my dumper type shit,55
9894,Please shuffle tutorial,23
9895,Oh my god,9
9896,oh my god üò®üò® nigga u can dump roblosüò±üò±üò± omg pro haker tech me how!111!!,71
9897,Tho I was able to find fireclickdetector using classinformer on an older ida,76
9898,Only a handful of plugins work for me,37
9899,Ye I have the same issue,24
9900,You can just find them to use that,34
9901,They don't shuffle the offsets right,36
9902,doesnt show in the section either for lovre but it shows all the shit for him so the plugin somehow works for him,113
9903,does not show in the plugin section either,42
9904,I put it in the folder shit does nothing,40
9905,Does not work,13
9906,use class informer,18
9907,I wanna see how it looks on web client,38
9908,imma give u an xref to search for in a second,45
9909,im too lazy to dump myself,26
9910,do u have a new dump,20
9911,my love .pdb üòç,14
9912,you could potentially scan for a vftable for me,47
9913,I mean,6
9914,to fuck ur brain,16
9915,oh no fuckery üò±,15
9916,right one is newest studio,26
9917,left one is studio 2022,23
9918,They def did some fuckery,25
9919,ah yes yes,10
9920,imma see if I can do anythin,28
9921,I cant find them even with the vftable,38
9922,I think they might hide those shitty funcs now,46
9923,I dont have a new dump rn but ill tell u how to get it if I find anything,73
9924,to see if it actually is 8,26
9925,imma lyk if I find anything,27
9926,tryna find ->get is a pain in the ass,37
9927,on my 64 bit program,20
9928,That shit used a 32 bit type,28
9929,never used it since then,24
9930,before,6
9931,I had issues with auto befor,28
9932,imagine thats why u crash,25
9933,auto is bad,11
9934,üò†,1
9935,also whats up with auto,23
9936,late 2022,9
9937,thats from 2022,15
9938,not sure,8
9939,let me see,10
9941,which one of these would it most likely be,42
9942,cuz u noob thats why,20
9943,"RBX::Reflection::PropDescriptor<RBX::Instance,RBX::UniqueId>::GetSetImpl",72
9944,then its 8,10
9945,thats even what ur looking for,30
9946,but I dont think,16
9947,thats not updated,17
9948,I dont think thats it,21
9949,with some service,17
9950,I know that u can make a bootleg variant,40
9951,What do u need it for,21
9952,like this?,10
9953,Theres so many,14
9954,let me check if I can find smth,31
9955,oh I see,8
9956,what ru talking about,21
9957,what property getter,20
9958,by doing it,11
9959,Quit skidding,13
9960,ok still need help,18
9961,actually maybe not,18

10250,because u are doing it,22
10251,and stop being pressed,22
10252,pull ur dildo out femboy nigga,30
10253,is what i learned yesterday,27
10254,what i told u,13
10255,slowly,6
10256,im learning about internal,26
10257,i know what im doing,20
10258,i wish,6
10259,do you have the shared_ptr offset,33
10260,im learning nigga,17
10261,where i said its for external,29
10262,offset for job is for internal,30
10263,get a brain,11
10264,Wo ist der Griff ... wo ist der Griff?,38
10265,minussmall plz shu,18
10266,pushinstance,12
10267,about internal idk any shit,27
10268,and just esp program with how to make offset dumper,51
10269,exploit,7
10270,i figured out about external,28
10271,pro learning,12
10272,my history of learning,22
10273,all u do is moaning congrats trying to accuse me or sum,55
10274,by looking in ida,17
10275,some job,8
10276,other image i needed to be sure about offset for job,52
10277,i had no idea about pushinstance so i asked,43
10278,about me,8
10279,thats why u moaning in retard vote,34
10280,u get paid with gay sex or sum nigga,36
10281,but are u pressed,17
10282,for xeno,8
10283,all shits,9
10284,it has,6
10285,and the offset dumper is for external exploit only,50
10286,what made u yap in retardvote,29
10287,nigga are u pressed about me,28
10288,I'm using 2025 source,21
10289,Hawk tuah talk tuah.,20
10290,Hawk tuah hawk tuah,19
10291,Unless you want to write external cheats,40
10292,Your memory read/writes will still be just as detected so there's really not much that kernel level opens up for in terms of injecting undetected,145
10293,Kernel mode to bypass a usermode anti tamper is crazy work imo,62
10294,I've been thinking about using Cazz's tutorial but I've heard he doesn't actually explain things and just gives you code to paste,129
10295,My goal is to go kernel but now I'm just gonna start off easy with basic usermode drivers,89
10296,After January ima lock in üôè,27
10297,"It's not a high ego, we're just correcting literal misinformation",65
10298,"Well I don't really care about crazy exploits, right now my focus is on making a good driver, which I haven't done enough research yet to be able to do.",152
10299,I'm trying to get better but it's just best to start with basic stuff,69
10300,"Not really long, I have basic knowledge but enough to be able to find everything. I'd say max 2 or 4 months I'm not exactly sure",128
10301,How long u been doing reverse engineering for,45
10302,f,1
10303,"I don't have an ego, I'll admit the shit I make is basic. I can only make basic esp with aimbot as of now, however cut me some slack because it hasn't even been a year since I've been invested in this.",201
10304,Basic words were usedüíÄ,22
10305,No1 did üíÄ,9
10306,Literally no one played with words,34
10307,crazy high ego,14
10308,y'all really plays with words,29
10309,"So if you skidded your DLL, then you probably wouldn't know",59
10310,You must have at some point added the image base,48
10311,Like literally if you've ever written a DLL that calls an internal function,75
10312,Not even research,17
10313,And I promise it makes life 500% easier,39
10314,"Exactly, a bit of research is all it takes.",43
10315,"Obviously ficello wouldn't know, he develops external pysploits",63
10316,"If you understand at all what the code of an internal exploit is doing, you'd know that the addresses you call are offset from the image base",141
10317,I mean in the guided hacking books that are free in <#1277823807779770449> should atleast tell you that it‚Äôs just the base addr + offset. It really only takes a bit of reading.,176
10318,Just open source ninovium,25
10319,<var></var>,11
10320,you need to run it using html,29
10321,this is the source,18
10322,bro is not getting the source,29
10323,send me a link boy,18
10324,fucc no,7

10332,"anyone have a dll to just inject? something like wearedevs, i am very familiar with making a frontend, i just need a dll and documentation",138
10333,These pysploit devs really think they're big names,50
10334,Tfw an address is just an offset from the image base,52
10335,wdym man addresses is the same as offsets!,42

10347,russian guy,11
10348,referred to that,16
10349,that sentence,13
10350,thats not even hard to find pushinstance,40
10351,roblox updated?,15
10352,for 2nd time,12
10353,okay swallow my cum bbg,23
10354,pls feed me,11
10355,im asking not begging,21
10356,u are embellishing,18

10360,PLS GIVE ME,11
10361,STOP GATEKEEPING STRING OMG,27
10362,PLSSS,5
10363,PLZ GIVE ME PUSHINSTANCE STRING,31
10364,where nigga,11
10365,you are?,8
10366,cuz im not begging?,19
10367,spoonfeeds u shit,17
10368,thats why no one,16
10369,scary,5
10370,cuz i will cum on u,19
10371,watch ur head when u go outside,31
10372,find it urself,14
10373,pull ur dildo out and stop gatekeeping a string omg,51
10374,i manually go through the memory regions and look for it,56
10375,i dont use strings,18
10376,you just find it man,20
10377,"""Spoonfeed me please!!!"" ^^^",28
10378,thanks for offsets but which string i should search in ur ida to find pushinstance,82
10379,yeah?,5
10380,they're for ida pro right?,26
10381,You can convert it types to pointer type to make it look prettier in psuedocode view instead of + offset it will be subscript [idx] instead,139
10382,functions are aligned at 0x10 so look there,43
10383,"Look for common function signature like push rbp mov rbp, rsp if it's not a function then press p to tell IDA to analyze it",123
10384,You can also use breakpoint for same trick,42
10385,I use dsync so I can see which line in the psuedocode view correspond to in the disassembler,92
10386,"Use the decompiler and if it won't decompile, you can nop out the probamatic instructions",89
10387,"Class Informer, Auto RE sig scan and all those stuff will auto name stuff for you so you can easily look at stuff",113
10388,Also you should use a bunch of extensions it'll make ur life easier,67
10389,bro my offsets come from my dumper not IDA,42
10390,"also I saw you used to post stuff on offsets, any tips or know anything I can use to get better at analyzing ida?",113
10391,so if I was defining print in my exploit I'd do the address like this?\n\nGetModuleHandleA(0)+ 0x1412638B0-0x140000000,118
10392,it's on  about ASLR stuff or something I forgor,47
10393,for 64 bit it's 0x140000000 for 32 bit it's 0x400000,52
10394,cuz it looks like I have an extra 14 at the start,49
10395,how do I know what value to rebase by?,38
10396,You didn't rebase,17

10488,That's all I do,15
10489,Did you make any pure c exploits,32
10490,yeah pure C is a better calling,31

10546,idk ask him,11

10603,its possible to make a exploit in every lang,44
10604,wait i think it can be possible to make an exploit in pascal,60
10605,malbolge exploit soon,21
10606,idk lol,7
10607,what about vinyl,16
10608,also c# is possible,19

10632,there is some mem libs in javascript,36
10633,how is that universally possible,32
10634,next is making an exploit in javascript,39
10635,no more c++,11
10636,would be funny,14
10637,i should give it to everyone so every skids will use plain C to make an exploit lol,83
10638,I also made a plain C exploit just for the funnies,50
10639,Until it has to decompile control flow,38
10640,It's honestly not even half bad,31
10641,Nah celery has their own decompiler,35
10642,Wouldn't use anything made by him,33
10643,Ficello is a pysploit dev,25
10644,to use for decompling i think,29
10645,i mean plusgaint gave them konstant,35

10760,"no, that's wrong.",17
10761,shii,4
10762,u can still pull info as long as you avoid protected or monitored objects,73
10763,"ok i don't care, let's go gambling",34
10765,"Yeah, reading directly from Roblox objects might give junk data at first, but there are ways to filter it and pull out useful info you just need to know how to work around it a bit üòâ",182

10771,"so reading is fine, but that just gets u junk data usually",58
10772,"any access to roblox objs, which are out of sync with the task scheduler get detected",85
10773,if you're getting detected its because youre writing to monitored objects,73

10788,Show the code that dumps your offsets,37
10789,ofcourse roblox doesnt belong to me,35
10790,i manually reversed the offsets what are u on lil bro,53
10791,its not yours,13
10792,or  i dont remeber,18
10793,uh i think that was for GetTaskScheduler,40
10794,now i go work on execution,26
10795,which ones,10
10796,but thats fine,14
10797,some again,10
10798,i had to get,12

10812,or dump them,12
10813,the offsets,11
10814,did u even reverse,18
10815,well if the format is good enough to understand giving credit where thats due,77
10816,the addys i got them with my dumper,35
10817,are you retarded i just copied your format,42
10818,updated for latest version,26

10820,why are u resending my shit,27
10822,roadblox... a name I've heard before... ü§î,41
10823,Brcause roadblox can detect rpm...,34
10824,depends on what your going to read obviously,44
10825,alright nice,12
10826,Oh well it works now but its gonna cut stuff up with a smaller chunksize,72
10827,p sure that error means it‚Äôs trying to access too much data so I‚Äôll reduce the buffer size,90
10828,"code just loops through all the memory in the game and reads it into a buffer of 64 KB each time, and prints it out with error code 299",135
10829,what are u trying to read,25
10830,"Not crashing, readprocessmemory just returns false",50
10831,works since march,17
10832,and ur good to go,17
10833,just lock the virtual memory and unlock it later on,51
10834,if ur crashing that means ur trying to read something that has traps,68
10835,what happens if u do it on player version,41
10836,i dont know what ur doing but readprocessmemory works fine,58
10837,"And for some reason readprocessmemory doesn‚Äôt work on regular roblox plr for me, only ms version",96
10838,"Swear I heard some cheats only work on the ms store version, but it was a while ago so it could‚Äôve been the other way around",124
10839,I cheat on the native client,28
10840,Fuck if I know,14
10841,"Wait so if it‚Äôs easier to bypass, why is it not preferred?",58
10842,"But if you're gonna bypass Hyperion, might as well do it on the native client",77
10843,Well I suppose the ms client version has a lobotomized version of Hyperion which makes it easier to bypass,106
10844,We don't?,9
10845,also could anyone explain why exploiters like to use the microsoft store version of roblox and not the web download version,123

11752,bro its l top - stack,21
11753,ok it is,8
11754,üôèüò≠,2
11755,It's insane how you have no idea how the lua stack even works,61
11756,L->top - L->stack,17
11757,your doing,10
11759,ur so smart,11
11760,why did i read it all,21
11761,Ye I'd do the same,18
11762,lmao fr,7
11763,p->k changed,12
11764,i see the issue u big faggot,28
11765,oooh,4
11766,p->k?,5
11767,You've been at it for a month,29
11768,Stop skidding my shit and try figuring out how to set capabilities yourself,75
11769,give me a hint,14
11770,But I won't tell ü§´,18
11771,what is it,10
11772,"The funny thing is, I know exactly what your issue is",53
11773,proto->sizep 0xA8,17
11774,proto->userdata = 0x78,22
11775,proto->p = 0x18,15
11776,is this correct,15
11777,that way ill know how everything works,38
11778,bro i better just make my own roblox and then make a hack for it,64
11779,Use addr2index,14
11780,should i use index2addr,23
11781,help me,7
11782,I just send screenshots of the code from time to time to help people,68
11783,how did this skid steal it,26
11784,It's not open source,20
11785,(if this is yours),18
11786,open source shit,16
11787,why would u even make,21
11788,and 6,5
11789,shuffle4,8
11790,and i have shuffle,18
11791,hope u get a whole gangbang,27
11792,Absolutely loving the fact you skidded that shit off of my executor and can't even get it to work üòÇ,99
11793,im sueing roblox then,21
11794,because ur black,16
11795,this skidded shit sucks,23
11797,then whys mine the same,23
11798,just tell if its supposed to be the same,40
11799,u really think my explaination was a real think,47
11800,is it supposed to be the same,29
11801,fucking nigger,14
11802,i was playing w u,17
11803,its syscall,11
11804,doesnt intercept,16
11805,the stack located onto the internal vm,38
11806,so when roblox updates its func,31
11807,onto luavm call,15
11808,just set a breakpoint,21
11809,bro üôè,5
11810,yeah that's the best method,27
11811,i aint gonna do allat,21
11812,^^ can confirm,14
11813,"index2address doesn't update its func, you will need the luavm call handle so it's flow stack doesn't buffer overflow",117
11814,L->top can't be a lua closure,29
11815,should i use index2adddr,24
11816,wonder why,10
11817,do u think its going to work after reading it?,46
11818,it explains everything u gotta do,33
11819,read my explaination bro,24
11820,is this wrong,13
11821,that's why,10
11822,onto the stack,14
11823,it's flow state is called,25
11824,put a breakpoint onto the NtQueryVirtualMemory system call so the size of L->top will just be a closure,103
11825,Ez,2
11826,I just replace Roblox's lua state with my own one,49
11827,bro this is the shit  gave me,29
11828,Bro y'all still using protos???,31
11829,to,2
11830,you have,8
11831,mines raped,11
11832,IT DOESNT UPDATE ITS FUNCTION,29
11833,and fucked,10
11834,L-> TPOP IS LOCATED ONTO THE STACK,34
11835,then why is mine raped,22
11836,i alr told u,12
11837,üò≠ üôè,3
11838,whys my proto always the same,29
11839,:osb,4
11840,always,6
11841,whys mine the same,18
11842,no cause the proto waits for L->top size so the cast located onto the stack won't wait for multiple single objects so it just calls the whole func,146
11843,tf is that,10
11844,Just intercept the load protocol,32
11845,Protos are detected,19
11846,is the proto supposed to be always the same,43
11847,Monke,5
11848,Dnc,3
11849,you ruined my gif!!!,20
11850,means that to find shuffles you need nokia 337,46
11851,Bro give this man smart role already,36
11852,so the shuffles have a breakpoint set on INT3,45
11853,which intercept its own syscall trought JMP instruction,55
11854,now its a hexadecimal packet,28
11855,roblox updated their Vlvm value,31
11856,you cant find shuffles anymore,30
11857,+ vmvalues,10
11858,I only have to find shuffles?,29
11859,"okay, im update its",19
11860,can someone send full incognito source 2026,43
11861,its also right below the function,33
11862,its?,4
11863,and volume control is done,26
11864,youll find it,13
11865,its in here,11
11866,so i know where to find it,26
11867,i checked again,15
11868,and i found them again,22
11869,wdym i legit sent u them,24
11870,why tf do u need that,21
11871,how get LuaH_DummyNode,22
11872,i read the clvm documents and looked at the source,50
11873,yee,3
11874,ye but for those you result to uing robloxs vm,46
11875,you gotta use roblox's vm,25
11876,i mean update times the only good thing but find the op code instruction values to convert luau bytecode to lua bytecode is annoying,132
11877,in ur CLVM,10
11878,You also cant call functions from roblox local / modulescripts,62
11879,clvm is useless,15
11880,cus that ran in another vm roblox vm couldnt access that,56
11881,and that was possible because of clvm?,38
11882,or modified,11
11883,from being stolen,17
11884,to run,6
11885,so that protected scripts?,26
11886,that only worked on synapse,27
11887,obfuscation,11
11888,basically,9
11889,i enever used synapse alot,26
11890,wait tobais what was,20
11891,"You gotta handle yielding, use a C wrapper",42
11892,also doesnt stuff like yeild functions work out of the box?,59
11893,Cuh,3
11894,roblox exploit without Luau::execute ü§Ø,38
11895,cus your not hooking stuff or using major bypasses,50
11896,i thought that was better in stability than sonmething like,59
11897,and such,8
11898,crashes are more likely,23
11899,execution,9
11900,but does that degerade game performance or only how long that takes to execute a script,87
11901,your not using roblox so that makes sense,41
11902,i mean yea thats an external lua state,38
11903,than smth like Bytecode Conversion,34
11904,atleast what i heard ovm was faster than robloxs vm,51
11905,CLVM has overall worse performance,34
11906,that total depends on your vm,29
11907,why shouldnt that be better,27
11908,CLVM has horrible performance,29
11909,you dont need to update that as much,36
11910,wouldnt clvm be the best option rn,34
11911,machine,7
11912,virtual,7
11913,custom,6
11914,so its a,8
11915,lbi is a bytecode interpreter for Lua written in Lua. It aims to allow\n    the safe and fast emulation of Lua bytecode where using the standard C \n    facilities for this would be dangerous.,192
11916,LBI,3
11917,oh u mean clvm,14
11918,i saw someone saying celery was using the wintrust method,57
11919,dunno if I spelt that right,27
11920,or smth like that,17
11921,Lua Bytecode Interpreter,24
11922,but afterwards they free everything,35
11923,tf is lbi,9
11924,they go internal,16
11925,oh they went internal?,22
11926,the LBI gets ran with luavm::load tho,37
11927,Celery uses an LBI,18
11928,i havent reached that far,25
11929,idk what that used for,22
11930,yesnt,5
11931,io dont think any of them uses proto or clvm,44
11932,ages ago,8
11933,all the executors that are public use bytecode rn right,55
11934,lua_createtable wasnt even working,34
11935,My luau source is fucked I think,32
11936,to update luau src,18
11937,I used the offset way backkkk,29
11938,ill probably just change it back to original source tho,55
11939,just to update the whole luau src?,34
11940,whats the point of getting that,31
11941,I dont think I call it in my code anywhere,42
11942,via the offset,14
11943,I update it in the luau src,27
11944,No like,7
11945,luau_Execute,12
11946,why do you use that then,24
11947,bytecode conversion,19
11948,i thought you did,17
11949,what do you use that for,24
11950,the only reason you would need that is for proto conversion or clvm,67

12670,if i use your logic then yes,28
12671,are you stupid?,15
12672,if it has the word state in it then its obviously luastate right?,65
12673,i do know the answer to it,26
12674,ask questions you know the answer to,36
12675,what are you fucking stupid?,28
12676,why do u think he didn't reply,30
12677,ts nigga asking what lua state is üôè,35
12678,do you even know what lua state is?,35
12679,relying on woffle to help you with everything,45
12680,theres nothing called gnil,26
12681,you paste,9
12682,i knew it,9
12683,stupid dumbass,14
12684,theres legit nothing called gnil,32
12685,what is the gnil offset?,24
12686,lua state top offset,20
12687,the offset?,11
12688,L->global,9
12689,do you know what l->top or base is,34
12690,L->base,7
12691,to access stuff like,20
12692,i need it for lua state struct,30
12693,ballistic skid,14
12694,do you even know what a shuffle is for?,39
12695,give this guy smart role!!,26
12696,"""spoonfeed me"" üò±",16
12697,mine wrong,10
12698,can u spoonfeed me,18
12699,Nothing ever just works for. Me,31
12700,Are you on win 10?,18
12701,works for me normally,21
12702,(he doesnt know),16
12703,How do you get it to work?,26
12704,Won't even work. With the test dll u sent yesterday,51
12705,do you have any other injectors it just never works,51
12706,I didnt bother updating yet,27
12707,im not sure if its my code or the shuffle,41
12708,"i tested it, it didnt work",26
12710,is this shuffle6 correct,24
12711,where in ida,12
12712,find it,7
12713,ples,4
12714,i need shuffle6,15
12715,"Hi, I'm a nuclear retard.\n\nAre you a skid?",44
12716,what is shuffle6,16
12717,its im reversing,16
12718,Thats for ballistic I think,27
12719,no one is helping u making inco pastes,38
12720,its right?,10
12722,With kernal or what?,20
12723,Write your own,14
12724,Is there any injectors that work and that are reliable?,55
12725,its very easy,13
12726,roblox src 2016 doesnt use pseudo2 addr,39
12727,just use luau src / roblox src,30
12728,Find that out urself,20
12729,i would get it from index2addr but its inlined,46
12730,where do i find pseudo2addr,27
12731,2nd to last function called has both top and base,49
12732,the easiest way is just to find a function which calls gettop,61
12733,I already told you that,23
12734,from gettop,11
12735,where would i get top and base offset?,38
12736,and can just call that,22
12737,if u know about that func,25
12738,why would u get offsets,23
12739,from the setprotocontext,24
12740,get what,8
12741,i get them from loadstring() is not avaliable right,51
12742,unless the struct changes,25
12743,its always the same offset,26
12744,userdata isnt shuffled,22
12745,Proto->userdata,15
12746,yes ofc,7
12747,so ill need to get their offsets,32
12748,Proto->sizep,12
12749,Proto->p,8
12750,and i cant access structs like,30
12751,just find a function where lua_gettop is called,47
12752,that isnt hard,14
12753,also i would need to get L->top and L->base myself,50
12754,but its not needed,18
12755,if you can get it from ur dump then you can do that,51
12756,you also dont need nilobject,28
12757,whatever you wanna call it,26
12758,fields / members,16
12759,they just shuffle fields of a struct,36
12760,theres only a few exceptions which you dont really need,55
12761,and what they do,16
12762,i dont understand how shuffles work,35
12763,lua functions,13
12764,You basically cant use any,26
12765,topointer uses structs with shuffles,36
12766,ill do that,11
12767,i tried using lua_topointer from memory btw,43
12768,yeah what else,14
12769,memory,6
12770,in a dump,9
12771,u need to find it,17
12772,or i can use the one in luau,28
12773,will i also need to make my own pseudo2addr,43
12774,for ur own version,18
12775,obviously not really needed,27
12776,should i remove that,20
12777,CHECK,5
12778,api_CHECK,9
12780,you only need top base and pseudo2addr,38
12781,but alright,11
12782,It doesnt need ci,17
12783,```\nL->ci->top\nL->top\nL->base```,35
12784,Roblox uses it for Encryption and you use reverse math to use it for Decryption,79
12785,it needs,8
12786,i tried making index2addr but,29
12787,Encryption / Decryption for Values,34
12788,one vmvalue,11
12789,you also need vmvalues,22
12790,make my own index2addr?,23
12791,how am i supposed to set protos then,36
12792,fack,4
12793,via the struct,14
12794,Thats obviously why you cant access top,39
12795,in the struct,13
12796,did you place the shuffles,26
12797,i want to use stuff like,24
12798,afterwards,10
12799,what u tryna do with this,25
12800,idk why it isnt working,23
12801,is it possible to cast it to lua_State*,39
12802,also that looks fine,20
12803,not globalState,15
12804,then its the mainthread,23
12805,its the decrypted state,23
12806,globalstate isnt a lua state,28
12807,globalstate is a uint64_t,25
12809,ur doing sum wrong then,23
12810,did that and it returns nothing,31
12811,(lua_State*)(),14
12812,or C-Style casting,18
12813,reinterpret_cast<lua_State*>(),30
12814,when i do it returns nothing,28
12815,how do i cast a decrypted state address to a lua_state*,55
12816,ul_reason_for_call == 1,23
12817,md exists...,12
12818,he is either a 7 year old or a 80 year old,42
12819,i prolly did something wrong theres no syntax on discord..,58
12820,sigmas do\nif (sl_reason_for_call == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH){\nentry()\n},69
12821,Yeah it fixed it,16
12822,is there a way to fix it?,25
12823,restart your pc,15
12824,i know because roblox will not open after you try to allocate a console,71
12825,how did u know,14
12826,did you try allocate a console?,31
12827,why wont my roblox open anymore?,32
12828,yeah it worked,14
12829,createthread,12
12830,He said not to,14
12831,you dont have to createthread,29
12832,nigga.. wdym not needed,23
12833,not needed,10
12834,CreateThread,12
12835,No??,4
12836,still didnt work,16
12837,imma turn on my pc,18
12838,good?,5
12839,sry im a bit sped üíÄ,19
12840,oh shi,6
12841,where is reason for call shit,29
12842,so like this?,13
12843,restart roblox btw,18
12844,instead of std thread detach,28
12845,entry();,8
12846,do,2
12848,just call entry();,18
12849,also put the nexthook at the last part of the code,50
12850,on the dll,10
12851,don't do thread detach i guess,30
12852,i cloesed the console but didnt inject,38
12853,dll name should be  and the same callback,41
12854,yeah looks right,16
12856,ill get my,10
12857,not my injector,15
12858,old patch bytes btw,19
12859,well I don't use swhx injection anymore so maybe it's patched,61
12860,that's weird,12
12861,the message box didnt even show,31
12862,it says that but dont think the dll got injected,48
12863,this is my dll,14
12864,how am i a skid for trying to help ppl,38
12865,(you are),9
12866,bro i aint a skid,17
12867,"`extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport) int NextHook(int code, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { return CallNextHookEx(NULL, code, wParam, lParam); }`\n^^ just add this somewhere in ur code",181
12868,"oh ye also ur DLL needs a function called ""NextHook"" for that injector to work",78
12869,u can just build this and use it,32
12870,he is a SKID,12
12871,do NOT listen to that guy,25
12872,yea np,6
12873,cuz im about to sleep,21
12874,maybe tomorrow,14
12875,im on my phone rn,17
12876,i would give u it but,21
12877,is it on github?,16
12878,don't got link,14
12879,send link,9
12880,setwindowshookex but it's detected,34
12881,anyone know of an injector for roblox?,38
12882,neutral,7
12883,Am i smart or am i retarde,26
12884,good,4
12885,Starting with pixelated and sproute,35
12886,fr tho,6
12887,this server has so many smart people,36
12888,i will shut up,14
12889,srry,4
12890,big ah anti cheat,17
12891,dam,3
12892,user level,10
12893,is robloxs ac usermode or kernal mode?,38
12894,if its for personal use or learning then it doesnt matter,57
12895,detect on inject ü§ë,18
12896,if i were you i would plan ahead and go internal,48
12897,This is factual,15
12898,My nigga is gonna stick the bytecode into the memory and hope it works üíÄ,72
12899,ah yes i remember seeing that on a video,40
12900,a1 will be the type of print you want\n0 = plain print\n1 = info\n2 = warn\n3 = error,85
12901,just get ur addr and call it,28
12902,u can use poolparty or some other tp method to create remote threads,68
12903,better doing it internally if you plan on making an executor,60
12904,oh just do shellcode injection,30
12905,printing to the console,23
12906,doing what exactly?,19
12907,how would i go about doing it external?,39
12908,can be done externally,22
12909,recommend going internal but if its just print then it doesnt matter,68
12910,ye if you made injector work,28
12911,should i be doing this internal?,32
12912,yeah thats what i mean,22
12913,Make your own function with this address,40
12914,god no,6
12915,so i just remake that function?,31
12916,jumpout?,8
12917,Now the first line should make you understand,45
12918,what dumper do you use,22
12919,took me to this,15
12920,f5 will decompile the sub you are on,36
12921,you have to double click on the sub,35
12922,it did somthing for a split second,34
12923,what showed?,12
12924,i pressed F5,12
12925,Or just F5,10
12926,double click,12
12927,how?,4
12928,Worng pimg,10
12929,even if its just printing,25
12930,decompile the sub youre on,26
12931,You wanna know how to use no?,29
12932,decompile to what?,18
12933,12240F0,7
12934,The,3
12935,Decompile now,13
12936,i rebaed,8
12937,does this look right?,21
12938,ye pointer arithmetic,21
12939,if i dont,9
12940,oh will the offset be wrong?,28
12941,so your offset is 8,19
12942,so (QWORD*)v107 + 1 is the same as (QWORD)v107 + 8,50
12943,Rebase 0x0,10
12944,sizeof(QWORD) = 8\nsizeof(DWORD) = 4,36
12945,so to find the offsets u gotta just reverse the pointer arithmetic,66
12946,we know those are code and sizecode,35
12947,this is where the shit's being set,34
12948,no no,5
12949,there's NOTHING,15
12950,I made this IDB literally 15 minutes ago,40
12951,I want .pdb for get functions name üòî,36
12952,right above it is code,22
12953,shuffle9,8
12954,but that's the gist of it,25
12955,so it's hard to follow,22
12956,luaM_newarray is a macro which uses macros with use macros,58
12957,so like this is sizecode and code,33
12958,luavm::load isn't and it uses luau_load,39
12959,the bytes of doom,17
12960,lvm load,8
12961,u can infer the last one,24
12962,this has 3/4 offsets,20
12963,want a pro tip?,15
12964,took all day lmao,17
12965,"`#define LUAVM_SHUFFLE4(sep, a0, a1, a2, a3) a1 sep a3 sep a2 sep a0`\nsorry for late reply my IDA spent like an hour decompiling lvm load lmfao",144
12966,multiplication is the key here,30
12967,ill try 0x8,11
12968,you promised,12
12969,bad boy dont make me ask your daddy to get the belt,51
12970,Before u diss them,18
12971,Try it üíÄ,8
12972,its 0x1 bro,11
12973,say ong it is,13
12974,HAHAHAHAH,9
12975,cap,3
12976,now fuck off,12
12977,0x35,4
12978,LMAOOOO,7
12979,if i give you offset will you fuck off,38
12980,(its not 0x0),13
12981,Ain't no way homie been at this for more then 2h+ asking for sht,64
12982,"doesnt listen & paster & skid, can you give him a role ?",56
12983,in return,9
12984,what do i get,13
12985,want the offset?,16
12986,NOBODY here is feeding you the offset bud,41
12987,FR,2
12988,offset itself,13
12989,Wat,3
12990,Np,2
12991,here's the code to get L->top from my dumper,44
12992,yea most of them cant get simple offsets/addresses like luavmload,65
12993,thank you so much,17
12994,can you role pixelated nicerd smth this was please?,51
12995,which this retard is too retarded to get,40
12996,"idc if people have my code, they still need to get offsets",58
12997,(it isn't),10
12998,what is L->top,14
12999,Finna search now üíÄ,18
13000,it is sad that it is working,28
13001,i want L->top,13
13002,Ain't no way üíÄ,14
13003,i ‚ù§Ô∏è skids,10
13004,everyday for the past month he has been asking woffle to write a bit of his executor,84
13005,he copied his code 1:1,22
13006,Nvm ChadPou,11
13007,jesus christ please strike this retards soul down.,50
13008,and idk how to get top,22
13009,Maybe he dont use like you do po,32
13010,i need L->top,13
13011,how fucking retarded,20
13012,"to get a proto, u just cl->",27
13013,you fucking idiot,17
13014,i cant get protos,17
13015,what is a p i dont want p i want protos,39
13016,i dont want set nigga,21
13017,omds nigga,10
13018,NIGGA... HOW THE FUCK YOU THINK THIA LOOK LIKE???\n,51
13019,ida crack off,13
13020,Yall mfs got like a 90909090x combo on this guy,47

13023,what is a top?,14
13024,what is a cl,12
13025,what is a p? hello i am pixelated,33
13026,somethings wrong with it,24
13027,the code I use,14
13028,this is deadass,15
13030,true.,5
13031,lua_topointer doesnt work,25
13032,just get them off the stack,27
13033,how can i set caps if i dont have protos,40
13034,i dont want to set caps nigga i want to get protos,50
13035,you just can not read,21
13036,(it tells you EXACTLY hwo to set caps),38
13037,he is helping you,17
13038,so hlpful,9
13039,That as a phone wallpaper goes crazy,36
13040,Idk if he can read üòî,20
13041,eat drink skid repeat,21
13042,he only knows the basics of survival,36
13043,his tiny undeveloped brain can not store anymore knowledge,58
13044,fucking dont read code,22
13045,it breaks,9
13047,when i do this,14
13048,But you still be skid,21
13049,Not one of these guys gonna help you üíÄ,38
13050,nigga if you dont know then use a source open and use it,56
13051,Bro learn first instead of tryna get it spoonfed,48
13052,bruuuh,6
13053,is something wrng with it,25
13054,ponter arithmetic? never heard of it,36
13055,this man knows NO C++,21
13056,fuck off,8

13063,you pasted,10
13064,whats wrong with t,18
13065,plees,5
13066,what offset is even wrong,25
13067,it's 2 weeks old now,20
13068,"well, ""old""",11
13069,so I just keep it all in an old IDB,35
13070,and I cba to do that for EVERY version,38

13073,you are asking woffle to write your whole executor,50
13074,look at yourself,16
13075,retard?,7
13076,ky,2
13077,no faggot,9
13078,oit,3
13079,whats wrong,11
13081,property of mr ninov,20
13082,thats what wrong,16
13083,waats wrong with it,19
13084,I have an old IDB where I keep all my structs,45
13085,and still fail,14
13086,you are being fed the code directly,35
13087,"""not skidding""",14
13088,only form u,11
13089,you 1:1 copied my code,22
13090,not skiding,11
13091,the skidding is wild,20
13092,fucking retard,14
13094,hello lovre,11
13095,ok sec,6
13096,doesnt work,11
13097,u can find it in lvm load,25
13098,now time to test,16
13099,i casted it to lua_state*,25
13100,Woffle check dms for secs,25
13101,Hi chat,7
13102,where 99% of it was waiting ofr the strign xref,47
13103,he will be crying for offsets every week,40
13104,took me like 2 mins from opening IDA to findign the offset,58
13105,so he looks smart,17
13106,üôèüôè,2
13107,why are you still working on this bro if you're 100% relying on spoonfeeds,74
13108,not sharing it üôè,16
13109,i am david,10
13110,i also do not use lua state i modify roblox to run my code,58
13111,gang I have FOUND the L->top offset,35
13112,should i c ast it to a luastate,31
13113,you're just making it more retarded for urself,46
13114,that's still a pointer to a lua state,37
13115,for my state,12

13155,he is not a skid he is a top level shit eater,45
13156,do i just add L->top or do i put the offset for it,50
13157,he doesn't ban skids,20

13337,Ok explain then,15
13338,i do know,9
13339,Nobody knows how,16
13340,Everyone knows you have to set proto capabilities,49
13341,What you did is stated the obvious,34
13342,i just said,11
13343,you're just gonna call random internal functions hoping it works?,65
13344,what are you even trying to do,30

13354,explain,7
13355,like even now you have NO IDEA what you're doing,48
13356,just answer 1 question,22
13357,to figure out one line of code,30

13408,0 progress,10
13409,^^ btw this guy has been doing this shit for one month,54

13446,level 8 executor without lua is crazy,37
13447,then how did you make a level 8 executor?,41
13448,I dont know anything in the context of lua,42
13449,I told you,10
13450,should be easy,14
13451,and still got picked over anybody else to work with,51

13462,is wild,7
13463,your desperation,16
13464,ok define it,12
13465,so sigma and smart,18
13466,define extraspace/userdata,26
13467,the cope is wild,16
13468,skidded from protoware,22
13469,so yk,5
13470,but cant define proto,21
13471,I have working lvl 8 execution,30
13472,cant even define a proto,24

13487,no idea why they even have debug code in the client,51
13488,as long as you're not retarded,30
13489,is a gold mine for vmvalues,27
13490,Ik,2
13491,this isn't for state,20
13492,And 24 is the VmValue,21
13493,I only know that 32 is the base,31
13494,Dang,4
13495,Sang,4
13496,not even close,14

13498,What was 0x50 again?,20
13499,yep ik,6
13500,proto,5
13501,a lot of the encryptions are easy,33
13502,I mean still,12
13503,but you need encryptions for a lot of the functions as well,59
13504,shuffles are the easiest,24
13505,or literally 2 clicks if u use my dumper,40
13506,5 minutes to get,16
13507,shuffles take like,18
13508,To make YOUR own functions like\nlua_pushstring and stuff\nOr\nJust to use shuffles,83
13509,What better,11
13510,a week ago,10
13511,until woffle told them,22
13512,they didnt even know shuffles change,36
13513,protoware devs are incompetent af,33
13514,you wouldnt get it,18
13515,big,3
13516,not bug deal,12
13517,They can to find by theirself,29
13518,"theres a new upd, do y'all need new shuffles for protoware",58
13519,this is just,12
13520,like this isn't even Roblox related,35
13521,pop it off the stack????,24
13522,so i can set it,15
13523,bro i just asked how to get protos,34
13524,any chance he gets,18
13525,proceeds to ask for spoonfeeds,30

13527,"""i am here to learn""",20
13528,"""i stopped skidding guys""",25
13529,how do i get the proto,22
13530,the code,8
13531,wtf is proto->userdata = capabilities,37
13532,and you come in here and call other people skids????,52
13533,yet you're spending a MONTH on ONE LINE of code,47
13534,it's really not that difficult,30
13535,"And since you're so smart, how have you not figured out you can just do\nproto->userdata = capabilities",103
13536,Who would've thought????,24
13537,"Oh, almost as if setting capabilities in ls ud does nothing?????",64
13538,do not feed the troll,21
13539,this has gotta be ragebait guys,31
13540,I cant,6
13541,because im nto setting on protos dumbass,40

13543,on the userdata,15
13544,who halfway spoonfed this dude,30
13545,setting capabilities anywhere other than protos does nothing,60
13546,but not on protos,17
13547,i know how to set capabilities,30
13548,So where's your capability setter?,34
13549,"""I was spoonfed slightly more than this guy, must mean I'm smarter""",67
13550,can we normalize skids being self aware,39
13551,so shut the fuck up as well,27
13552,and you have no idea how to do proto->userdata = capabilities,61
13553,you dont even know what protos are so please stfu,49
13554,Who is Sproute?,15
13555,yeah i am,9
13556,the yap is wild,15

13799,It really isn't,15
13800,So its fine,11
13801,You still need to open up ida and look for them,47
13802,Can we stop spoonfeeding,24

13809,are you sure you know how to even find shuffle 4..?,51
13810,but you have to find them on your own,37
13811,oh i can tell you the method,28
13812,only shuffles 3-9,17
13813,there is no shuffle 1,21
13814,stuff like index2addr for example,33
13815,so you cant access them,23
13816,they shuffle core compnents in luau,35
13817,no thats much more,18
13818,you have to find what has been shuffled and how,47
13819,why the fuck would shuffles be there roblox shuffles the luau in the client so people cant just access things easily,116
13820,ye even i had no clue some time ago then i did some research you should try learning how to get them,100
13821,if roblox changes alot of things the methods will break,55
13822,best way to learn is to reverse,31
13823,i mean zayn,11
13824,so everyones skidding from ballistic,36
13825,which source?,13
13826,Are shuffles required in any case?,34
13827,also getting addresses isnt even hard,37
13828,you can just tell me here,25
13829,do you know how to get encs?,28
13830,you need them for setting capabilites to achive level 8 and env,63
13831,no you can achive execution with shuffles,41
13832,only some,9
13833,i dont know the method for all of them,38
13834,they are all responsible for different things,45
13835,what shuffle do you even want,29
13836,you can go ask him,18
13837,so idk if i can tell you,24
13838,also woffle gave me the method,30
13839,i dont think you will still understand,38
13840,ik the method,13
13841,but you still might not understand,34
13842,i mean you can go ask someone for a method,42
13843,them,4
13844,rather go learn how to get,26
13845,but that wont help you,22
13846,i can give you the shuffles,27
13847,you have to find them,21
13848,do you even know c++?,21
13849,even if you update all the shuffles offsets and enc you will have to code whatever was removed,94
13850,learn how execution works,25
13851,ye then there is no point in you finding offsets,48
13852,and have to make your own initilize script vm etc,49
13853,you cant get shuffles and enc first learn how that works also zayn removed parts of ballistic so you cant just skid,115
13854,why even find them,18
13855,im not find,11
13856,ballastic,9
13857,pussygiant14,12

14488,Man I have like barely any knowledge of this sht,48
14489,ur dodging rn,13
14490,and yoru does not know,22

14498,with the,8
14499,luaT_eventname,14
14500,üíÄ wtf,5
14501,you can't get shuffle 8?,24
14502,U jus said u get 8 ur self too,30
14503,üíÄ tf u mean ye,14
14504,someone just send me 8 and 9,28

14510,the dodging is insane,21
14511,where these,11
14512,breh,4
14513,u can find it in luaT_eventname,31
14514,Blud üíÄ,6
14515,Here I found it,15
14516,according to u btw,18
14517,all i gotta run is this larp's dumper,37
14518,want me to stream next update getting them myself?,50
14519,kinda stupid when u cant even get 8?,36
14520,"You get shuffle9 yourself, but you have no idea how the code around shuffle9 looks like?",88
14521,u just said u get 3-7 yourself,30
14522,just the biggest question in mind,33
14523,i get myself??,14
14524,"ok then this isn't Luau specific, this is actual roblox internals. Explain this",79
14525,okay who is ur provider,23
14526,there is no other way,21
14527,No sir its python,17
14528,other,5
14529,i get shuffle,13
14530,use the gif!,12
14531,use the gif,11
14532,its luau,8
14533,Say it,6
14534,yes it's fucking luaM_newarray,30
14535,it's roblox source code,23
14536,i hope,6
14537,im not such a dumbass after all,31
14538,i told shit looked like proto shit,34
14539,I know it's uh roblox source code,33
14540,now can we give this skid nuclear retard role,45
14541,smart guy,9
14542,bloody,6
14543,you MUST have looked at this code to figure out shuffle9,56
14544,that's bloody luau internals,28
14545,myself,6
14546,ye but i only got 3-7,21
14547,but he does,11
14548,not his,7
14549,U guys made my day,18
14550,ok yoru do you have shuffle9?,29
14551,heh,3
14552,freeproto kinda but its n ot it,31
14553,"since yoru has the latest shuffles and offsets, he should know exactly what this even is",88
14554,So I'm not a total dumbass,26
14555,ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,4
14556,it is it just includes some more code,37
14557,im 99% sure ive seen that multiple times when searching for proto stuff,71
14558,See my dumbass would think that's the same screenshot,53
14559,here I'll make it easier,24
14560,you have no idea what it is?,28
14561,"This function, which is called a dozen times in load",52
14562,where my bninja gang,20
14563,ida output is fucking gay,25
14564,Oh? You don't know?,19
14565,look so messy,13
14566,they always,11
14567,that's a function call,22
14568,also how the fuck does that look likea vmvalue,46
14569,For the kill,12
14570,try again,9
14571,Bro came for round 2,20
14572,this looks like a vmvalued value huh,36
14573,This fits,9
14574,explain what this pattern means,31
14575,ok  since you're so well versed with roblox internals,53
14576,I write C,9
14577,u mean HOLY C!,14
14578,his ass stands NO chance reading IDA pseudocode,47
14579,U JUST CALLED WOFFLE A LARP,27
14580,AINT NO WAY,11
14581,HUH,3
14582,he cannot even read nicely formatted C code,43
14583,you just a larp,15
14584,think what u think tbh,22
14585,yoru is a skid there's no need to prove it further,50
14586,nah i'm not scrolling,21
14587,I'm not scrolling üíÄ,19
14588,Scroll,6
14589,SALUTE,6
14590,They wanna know the answer,26
14591,but armandukx,13
14592,woffle ok,9
14593,Continue my friends,19
14594,sigma,5
14595,aigma,5
14596,Hes offline üíÄ,13
14597,reply to my dms blud,20
14598,Rip yoru,8
14599,And in the screen shot u could see the executor saying print,60
14600,"I get it by function, maybe ur getting it by offset",51
14601,I remember that time when sum guy jus did print for his identity msg,68
14602,but setidentity generally needs you to set identity in tls context,66
14603,Skibidi!,8
14604,ye probably,11
14605,I found it different ways,25
14606,Ah,2
14607,I never needed that and still got Level 8 execution?,52
14608,Thread Local Storage,20
14609,In 2 years come back to me üëç,28
14610,TLS Context?,12
14611,this shit got him,17
14612,Besides I'm too stupid rn to know what tf tls is,48
14613,I was gonna start simple and then ask more difficult questions,62
14614,and still no answer,19
14615,Ye I saw dat but thought that sht was a trap,44
14616,took yoru a solid 10 minutes,28
14617,Thank god i dont use shuffles and still got Everything i need üôè,63
14618,you can tell easily by the strings,34
14619,it's needed for setidentity,27
14620,btw that function just gets the TLS context,43
14621,To get clowned a second later,29
14622,Jus to be cool,14
14623,Cuz like why tf flex pasted sht when u don't know how it work,61
14624,for env and all shuffles,24
14625,hes charging 5$,15
14626,passive income ez,17
14627,Idk why ppl flex pasted sht,27
14628,I got a dumper,14
14629,I gotta get into that business,30
14630,immune is selling them btw,26
14631,actually too many,17
14632,"when a skid gets access to shuffles and encs, they're hailed like a god when they give it out",93
14633,Dam most ppl I've seen would say fuck off skid,46
14634,a lot of people,15
14635,"I thought I forgot to put ""end""",31
14636,Who's willing to do that tho,28
14637,u forgot :,10
14638,Idk what dis do sir pls help,28
14639,"```lua\nPrint(""haud)```",23
14640,and encs,8
14641,im 99% sure thats what he does for his shuffles,47
14642,Pls sir what does this do,25
14643,Or he went to sum1 dm to ask them,33
14644,Or he ran away üíÄ,16
14645,He ended himself ig,19
14646,He's def gone,13
14647,And blud didn't respond,23
14648,I spammed like 100+ msgs,24
14649,Skibidi?,8
14650,prior to this he couldn't even figure out what some simple C code does,70
14651,I have a update,15
14652,Ok so,5
14653,"Thats the skids These days, Bro..",33
14654,and he's nowhere to be seen,27
14655,so I asked him a BASIC question regarding roblox internals,58
14656,yoru claims to be smarter than me,33
14657,I Just joined this conversation,31
14658,Lool,4
14659,What are ya even talking about,30
14660,"You realize whatever environment you skidded DEPENDS on this function, right,  ?",80
14661,Chat GPT down i guess,21
14662,To reply,8
14663,I'm so bored ima spam his dms,29
14664,can't figure it out?,20
14665,Nvm he's def gone,17
14666,skibidi?,8
14667,u think?,8
14668,I think he's gone,17
14669,it's been 5 mins and yoru's nowhere to be seen,46
14670,I think I have a long way to go üíÄ,33
14671,reading the strings pretty much says it,39
14672,I remember buying a raspberry pi to never use it,48
14673,and yoru should know since a function in his UNC depends on this,64
14674,should be obvious what that function does just by looking at it for two seconds,79
14675,yoru is furiously pasting the code into various chatbots praying for something comprehensible,93
14676,agreegethumbsup,15
14677,the dodging is wild,19
14678,whicxh,6
14679,answer the question,19
14680,in my country,13
14681,is blocked,10
14682,gpt,3
14683,waiting for gpt to produce an answer,36
14684,am i dodging,12
14685,why you dodging yoru?,21
14686,I remember seeing sum like that,31
14687,I forgot where tho,18
14688,üíÄ isn't that from that leaked init script,41
14689,if localscript,14
14690,What rhe fuck is that,21
14691,and then check,14
14692,game:getdescendants,19
14693,bc it was,9
14694,getrunningscripts,17
14695,i removed the,13
14696,and the rest,12
14697,where did ur websockets go,26
14698,"ok yoru let's talk Roblox internals, since you claim to be so much more knowledgeable than me. What's this function used for?\n",127
14699,18/09,5
14700,NO wind yeahok fly,18
14701,im pretty sure he made wind? idk i dont remember,48
14702,Bet,3
14703,i mean id prove rn if i were u,30
14704,pasting wind doesn't count,26
14705,of me having internal before ballistic,38
14706,I have proofs,13
14707,Ever since incognito 1000000 executors appeared overnight,57
14708,"You couldn't explain the control flow of some simple C code, your ass was in Armans DMs just a few days ago BEGGING for the shuffle dumper, and you're flexing a build of ballistic or protoware",192
14709,wave no wind yes,16
14710,Wtf is wind,11
14711,leaked by some cat or whatever,30
14712,src,3
14713,wind,4
14714,urs,3
14715,all u had is just an identity setter,36
14716,which wind leak,15
14717,yeah but ur wind leak wasnt even close to env,45
14718,"""its just a coincidence""",24
14719,swhx user,9
14720,messagebox doesn't count,24
14721,even ur armandukx can prove,27
14722,U paste to flex( not u) ppl who jus paste,41
14723,1. i am 90 unc\n2. i was internal even before ballistic??,57
14724,It's jus there,14
14725,No sense of accomplishment,26
14726,wow 99% UNC,11
14727,MAD FACT,8
14728,AGREED,6
14729,and right after baliistic,25
14730,"funny how before ballistic, your ass was writing kernel mode lvl 3s",67
14731,Pasting = u don't learn,23
14732,I don't get ppl that paste tho,30
14733,with an injector,16
14734,a new working internal that everyones pasting,45
14735,fucking fat obese nigga,23
14736,What's ballistic,16
14737,proof when,10
14738,laugh,5
14739,Bros on the wall of shame forever üíÄ,35
14740,You're not a C++ expert just because you pasted ballistic,57
14741,the code I sent is some beginner level C,40
14742,you need to know C to even begin reversing roblox,49
14743,make it a gif,13
14744,fat obese nigga woffle,22
14745,I learnt useless sht like node js üíÄ,35
14746,i said in C,11
14747,Nono ima learn c++and basic sht,31
14748,read full,9
14749,bros gonna quit for 2 yrs,25
14750,ask roblox related shit,23
14751,anyways is wrong,16
14752,never said i knnow more than u,30
14753,I promise u,11
14754,anyway*,7
14755,Il say it in 2 yrs,18
14756,llol,4
14757,üòî couldn't clip,15
14758,says this then can't even explain some beginner level C code,60
14759,i have message logger :/,24
14760,just stay quiet yoru yoru ass is one of the biggest skids,57
14761,any,3
14762,you dont embarass,17
14763,Vouch,5
14764,before he could see it,22
14765,why? So I don't embarrass you again?,36
14766,then deleted it,15
14767,isnt that what i said? lol,26
14768,dont talk to me woffle,22
14769,"yeah 1 thing, woffle hates cpp",30
14770,this code is mad easy to follow given the variable names,56
14771,"you barely know C, let alone C++",32
14772,bother,6
14773,t,1
14774,i couldn,8
14775,due to the function name,24
14776,you just know what the function does,36
14777,and you still don't even know what the code does,48
14778,not even CLOSE,14
14779,you were entirely wrong,23
14780,getting,7
14781,"once again, forgot*",19
14782,you don't even stand a chance of writing one,44
14783,Why u spamming pictures to hide ur answer üíÄ,43
14784,no shit yoru ass was begging for the dumper,43
14785,Finna start w assault cube üî•,28
14786,After I learn üíÄ,15
14787,table offset,12
14788,I'll be back in 2 years,23
14789,gets,4
14790,Yeah anyway guys,16
14791,(has to read code),18
14792,yeah ik lol,11
14793,no func name this time,22
14794,he guessed last time from func name,35
14795,okay but u making it kinda too easy xd,38
14796,what does this even get?,24
14797,ok how about this one,21
14798,also this is totally not common with like all of the open sourced shit,70
14799,for assembly instructions,25
14800,dont know every opcode,22
14801,made in 15 min,14
14802,but it works only for 2 connections,35
14803,with 90% unc,12
14804,most likely read wrong but not having websockets also is weird,62
14805,you gave a shallow explenation based on the function name,57
14806,ok but what exactly does the code do?,37
14807,not that deep,13
14808,by reading instructions,23
14809,I got no clue,13
14810,Basically,9
14811,I can tell,10
14812,ur 1000% smarter than him and u know more than him.,51
14813,go on,5
14814,i dont have getfpscap?,22
14815,"since you're so much smarter than me, explain this piece of code from my dumper",79
14816,cause of the getfps,19
14817,90% sure some of it is from ballistic,37
14818,Dat internal?,13
14819,"knows more than me, who wrote the shuffle dumper",48
14820,so this guy who was BEGGING you for my shuffle dumper,53
14821,ima need a 2nd opinion here,27
14822,let me grab it,14
14823,where's your lvl8 internal?,27
14824,I wasted my time learning other languages üòî,43
14825,im not a skid i EVEN bet i know more than u lmao,48
14826,Im finna learn c++,18
14827,Cool,4
14828,what languages u know?,22
14829,get this skid banned,20
14830,oh? you pasted?,15
14831,nkwo,4
14832,Oh yeah it is,13
14833,i used a bit of incognito init script,37
14834,you know that that's not the actual code of JestGobals?,55
14835,it's 1:1 with incognito,23
14836,üíÄ no skids,10
14837,I'm here to jus read and learn,30
14838,incog pasted opinion rejected,29
14839,woffle would say,16
14840,incog ^^,8
14841,Anyway I'm starting to learn sht iknowwhereyoulive,50
14842,yorublox:,9
14843,Skid rating of 25% even tho I've never posted non except stickers fr,68
14844,The channel,11
14845,of me skidding,14
14846,where is proof,14
14847,mm,2
14848,once a skid always a skid,25
14849,leaderboard,11
14850,Apart from me being on skid leaderboard üòî,41
14851,I like dis community,20
14852,when will u stop hating me for no fucking reason lmao,53
14853,What's zed,10
14854,Rocketcore is the right answer,30
14855,clion,5
14856,Zed,3
14857,What do u guys prefer visual studio or vs code,46
14858,you need to set it per proto,28
14859,that still does nothing,23
14860,u set it in the lua state's userdata and in scriptctx,53
14861,setting capabilities in script context does nothing,51
14862,u dont get it,13
14863,how fucking slow are you,24
14864,and boom now everything is lvl3,31
14865,so it would set sc caps to 3,28
14866,"like if you have a RobloxScript, that NEEDS to be lvl 3",55
14867,"if the capabilities in the global state and the script context decided the capabilities for every proto, you wouldn't be able to restrict shit",142
14868,it does lol,11
14869,not meant,9
14870,but that's just if that method worked,37
14871,but as i said its just like a PoC,33
14872,since they're also now max cap,30
14873,wouldn't it be psis easy for internal acs to detect u???,56
14874,"besides, you mentioned setting caps in script context",53
14875,not iy,6
14876,i did a caps check,18
14877,running infinite yield doesn't mean u have max caps,51
14878,it works; u can see on my PoC tmrw,34
14879,you have to elevate all your protos,35
14880,that does nothing,17
14881,and it will work,16
14882,u gotta set max caps in script context,38
14883,and u can just bump caps in state and then,42
14884,i messed with shit,18
14885,ye but a month ago where i did these external shitsploits,57
14886,you do it in the protos,23
14887,you don't bump caps in the state,32
14888,you can bump caps too but idk its quite useless,47
14889,you can bump the identity ig but that's worthless,49
14890,"if you're commited to staying external, having the state helps you very little",78
14891,yeah but then what?,19
14892,5 lines,7
14893,no but scanner takes like,25
14894,problem?,8
14895,to call it,10
14896,probably shellcode,18
14897,useless effort,14
14898,you can call functions externally?,34
14899,not internal,12
14900,i mean like externally,22
14901,calling a function takes 0s,27
14902,1s,2
14903,takes,5

14905,"""lua state scanner"" goes hard üî•",31

15280,ok dowlnoiand decryptor,23
15281,why the fuck would you use syclla,33
15282,to dump,7
15283,then use that,13
15284,he has the decryptor,20
15285,he doesnt have that,19
15286,i will say to do that insteant,30
15287,just fucking run decryptor on  thats already there,50
15288,use gogo1000s decryptor,23
15289,why do u need dump,18

15295,no what the fuck,16
15296,read the pseudo code,20
15297,its index2addr,14
15298,literally go to loadstring check the sub above setprotocontext its the exact fucking same,89
15299,i dont use the loadstring method,32
15300,I  very pro,11
15301,i use shuffles for execution too,32
15302,did i say correct :d,20
15303,you use shuffles to elevate protos?,35
15304,you make no sense,17
15305,about,5
15306,what are you yapping,20
15307,thats index2addr,16
15308,i dont use that i use shuffles,30
15309,i think its the sub above setprotocontext,41
15310,go onto loadstring,18
15311,you need to get that from psuedo2addr,37
15312,is inlined,10
15313,YOU CANT index2addr,19
15314,bro thats shuffled,18
15315,its at the end of loadstring function,37
15316,just call robloxs,17
15317,thats only for people who cant get shuffles,43
15318,no need to look,15
15319,i dont use that,15
15320,you think i understand what you saying?,39
15321,you make your own custom functions for index2addr,49
15322,to elevate proto,16
15323,or 2,4
15324,the last 3 functions,20
15325,"just go to loadstring, at the end of it, you‚Äôll find index2addr just fucking copy EXACTLY how loadstring does it",112
15326,to find addys,13
15327,then look at luau source and reverse,36
15328,i can get print addy,20
15329,and yes he cant get shuffles,28
15330,yours is complicating it so much,32
15331,just follow this\nState Backup Begin\nElevate Lua State (Identity + Capability)\nCompile to Compressed Bytecode\nLuavm::load\nElevate All Proto's (Capability)\n\nState Backup End,178
15332,only print addy,15
15333,i cant get anything,19
15334,thats correct?,14
15335,i dont think he can get shuffles,32
15336,there are different methods,27
15337,go to the end,13
15338,look at the order elevating protos is after\nState Backup Begin\nElevate Lua State (Identity + Capability)\nCompile to Compressed Bytecode\nLuavm::load,151
15339,i lost the cheat sheet i made,29
15340,literally fucking search for loadstring it‚Äôll take you there,60
15341,yeah like i know how,20
15342,just go to loadstring function,30
15343,yapping about,13
15344,kinda,5
15345,is this man,11
15346,it starting to make sense,25
15347,and iterate through all child protos and set their capabilites,62
15348,it seems like both,18
15349,or both?,8
15350,this is for execution or getting lvl 8?,39
15351,no you need to get closure -> p,31
15352,State Backup Begin\nElevate Lua State (Identity + Capability)\nCompile to Compressed Bytecode\nLuavm::load\nElevate All Proto's (Capability)\n\nState Backup End,160
15353,or every time?,14
15354,if you will have to follow this order anyways,45
15355,once,4
15356,do i need to set  the proto's level to 8 before executing,57
15357,qusetion,8
15358,why?,4
15359,you will have to do this anyways,32
15360,but i wouldnt recommend that cus,32
15361,no just to execute things through luavm load is much simpiler,61
15362,im saving that,14
15363,thanks laot,11
15364,to get level 8,14
15365,scripts?,8
15366,execute?,8
15367,thats the order,15
15368,if ur talkinbout pointers,25
15369,a decompiler,12
15370,i need,6
15371,but how do i get the addys,26
15372,and make your own,17
15373,yes you reverse roblox,22
15374,go through this to understand how execution works,49
15375,then its patched üò≠,18
15376,this is a one pre hyperion,26
15377,but i lost the cheatsheet to find them :(,41
15378,there  helped me get,20
15379,there was the winverifytrust thing but pretty sure that got patched,67
15380,what more?,10
15381,you need much more than just that,33
15382,"just randomly look on v3rm, it‚Äôs not uncommon for them to get leaked",68
15383,ill study it,12
15384,ok send that i guess,20
15385,also the file he leaked to the public doesnt build since he removed stuff to avoid skidding,91
15386,i forgot luavm::load,20
15387,print,5
15388,idk luavm::load,15
15389,i think i can the spawn,23
15390,how are you gonna get the addys and shuffles and encs?,54
15391,to skid from that even if i do give you one,43
15392,i dont want more people,23
15393,i cant magically make one :/,28
15394,where can i find a source for a internal injector?,50
15395,thats not good...,17
15396,idk if thats a cpu or a poor gpu,32
15397,nigga u have a 100 dollar what ever that is,43
15398,idk den,7
15399,i didnt order a yappuccino,26

15402,shit pc,7
15403,da most,7
15404,that nigga could be usin,24
15405,no that doesnt,14
15406,u have no clue,14
15407,i use amd 5600g,15
15408,does the gpu matter?,20
15409,and gpu,7
15410,he means what cpu,17
15411,wtf does *what pc you use* mean,31
15412,a computer,10
15413,thats not a pc issue,20
15414,i havent used any except solara so idk,38
15415,what pc u use,13
15416,to load inf yeild in any decent external,40
15417,that usually takes less than 2 seconds,38
15418,it should not be taking that long,33
15419,with luau's compiler (modified for roblox (skidded)),52
15420,Probably a compiler issue,25
15421,idk what you are talking about bruh,35
15422,what external are you using that takes 3 fucking minutes to load,64
15423,i suppose,9
15424,in externals too and enc for unc,32
15425,you prob need shuffles anyways,30
15426,are instant,11
15427,intenals,8
15428,yea but you cant do much more than that,39
15429,it takes 3 mins to load inf yield,33
15430,i would have an exec by now,27
15431,yes but all i am saying is idk if this is relevant to you,57
15432,They‚Äôre easier but you can‚Äôt do much with them,46
15433,if i knew how to get offsets,28
15434,are problem,11
15435,but offsets,11
15436,externals are easier,20
15437,i never even bothered to look,29
15438,also idk how externals work,27
15439,how do you not know that,24
15440,explain it like i am 5 years old,32
15441,im confused bruh,16
15442,encryptions are vm values,25
15443,what is protos,14
15444,and for enc you need them for protos,36
15445,you need them to access luau functions since roblox shuffles luau build in the web client,89
15446,just want to confirm smt 0x110 and 0x88 updated right?,54
15447,im create theard,16
15448,what is enc and what is shuffles,32
15449,do you get those,16
15450,give me function proto!! (jk),29
15451,all you need to do is get addys shuffles and enc,48
15452,so that isnt even hard,22
15453,but if before the challenge was reversing everything and making that yourself but now there is alot of sources,110
15454,"plusgiant, did you get stuck in the lua_register problem before? because it doesn't let me put NULL in libname and only if I put the name then it works",151
15455,i want to make it myself :(,27
15456,so people cant skid everything,30
15457,yea you obv make that yourself thats why zayn left out some of the files,72
15458,make pro hack injector üò±,24
15459,"ok cutie~ sorry if im bein too much uwu @plusgiant5~ wanna take a break and watch some anime together? x3 \n@xspy ^w^ i can get us some nice comfy seats, hehe >:3",162
15460,and pasting whatever,20

15462,i want to make it myself,24
15463,im not saying t hat,19
15464,they fed everyone,17
15465,after ballistic leaked there source for ui drawing lib injector and module,74
15466,stop please,11
15467,"awww dont worry cutie~ im here to help u :3 @plusgiant5~ want a hand makin some injector magic? xD \n@xspy ~ i have all the offsets and signatures, let me just... ahem... ""dig them up"" for u >:3",194
15468,how is it easy?,15
15469,anyone can figure out,21
15470,now thats so easy bro,21
15471,for roblox*,11

15473,i cant even make an injector without skidding it,48
15474,so i do what i find easy,24
15475,im not good at all with reverse engineering,43
15476,everyone is skidding,20
15477,well internal is too hard for me,32
15478,thats external,14

15582,everything else looks fine,26
15583,but let me double check,23
15584,thanks for the info,19
15585,0x120FFF0 is print,18

15587,are these correct?,18

15590,anyone know what i miss for lua_pushvalue? because when i checked it crashed,76
15591,the offsets seem fine,21
15592,offsets internal,16
15593,This should be 0,16
15594,Task spawn doeant have task secluder,36
15595,roblox closed,13
15596,"I tried it, the result was the same",35

15600,"hmm, are there any analogues to spawn?",38
15601,u finally achieved smart role üôè,31
15602,idk why roblox closed,21
15603,man my execution is different now,33
15604,can you show it in dm,21
15605,roblox just closed,18
15606,not working,11
15607,and my shit worked,18
15608,I used to do the exact same thing,33
15609,shit man idfk,13
15610,well yeah but you get a different state,39
15611,when you setidentity,20
15612,well you set it to 8 anyway,27
15613,i always set it to 0 and it works,33
15614,it just closes,14
15615,roblox crashed,14
15616,I thought that wasn't a thing,29
15617,can you execute on the identity 0 state?,40
15618,you can also just do uinptr_t zero = 0; and then use that,57
15619,ye?,3

15624,wtf its null,12
15625,ur code is just haunted,23
15626,ok that looks fine,18
15627,best guess is his typedefs are wrong,36
15628,he decrements top,17
15629,spawn,5
15630,maybe it's truncating ur input,30
15631,then I really don't understand,30
15632,can you show your typedef for luavm::load and spawn,51
15633,should be good,14
15634,maybe its wrong,15

15654,correct?,8
15655,printidentity: 0xD46A10,23
15656,im not have printidentity offsets,33
15657,Try calling `printidentity` after load to see if load pushes some kind of error,79
15658,and expect it to work,21
15659,did bro really just include the .h files,40
15660,add luau libs,13
15661,i compiled luau and just loaded libs,36
15662,vs didnt detect luau files this why,35
15663,your VS doesn't find the implementation for compile,51
15664,could this mean anything?,25
15665,do you even have the Luau compiler source in your project?,58
15666,does your VS compile the Luau compiler?,39
15667,"try passing {2, 1, 0} as the 2nd arg",36
15668,that looks fine,15
15670,how do you call it?,19

15674,are you compiling with std=c++17?,33
15675,nah u dont need both src and lib,32
15676,ill try that,12
15677,i dont have linked lib tho,26
15678,i have included luau source code but everything works fine expect compile,73
15679,either include the source code in your project or link with a pre-build lib,75
15680,you need to link with Luau,26
15681,Do you use luau libs?,21
15682,its on Luau::compile,20

15688,cool!,5
15689,are you high?,13
15690,pseudo2addr is 0x25013F0?,25
15691,rest looks fine,15
15692,either your compress function is wrong or your encoder,54
15693,it doesn't run?,15
15694,remove the line that decrements top and see if it runs then,59
15695,ur shit looks right,19
15696,Top 16?,7
15697,ah nvm it's right,17
15698,ur top offset is probably wrong,31

15701,oh sick,7
15702,this right,10
15703,my sig for it was very bad,26

15745,cause i think i just do lua_pushvalue,37
15746,do you even have to use roblox's pushvalue,42

15888,didn't worked,13
15889,nigga i checked it before,25
15890,wish I had a struct for how roblox's userdata looks like,56
15891,just L->userdata,16
15892,I don't use offsets for userdata,32
15893,In which line should I look for it?,35
15894,find it out urself,18
15895,identity?,9
15896,in the namespace,16
15897,userdata,8
15898,who is incorrect,16
15899,"that is, incorrect offsets?",27
15900,Idk what it's error,19
15901,"Can you help me, before execute show it's error:",48
15902,"ciao bella~ :3 i luv speakin itawlian wif u! u wanna talk about da best pasta dish, maybe somethin spicy wif sausage? uwu",121
15903,speak italian,13
15904,they use luavmload,18
15905,artemis queues the script,25
15906,it would be only for optimization though,40
15907,especially if you want to run multiple scripts,46
15908,"well i mean from a programmer perspective, it would be better to queue a script through something anyway",104
15909,"hehe, oh woww! :3 u guyz r soooo clevew! xD gettin' exe's for ur friend lisst~ they're always sowwy tho when dey geusted :p",123
15910,idk if it makes a difference,28
15911,I've seen some executors do it,30
15912,also is it recommended to queue a script through the scheduler?,63
15913,it just comes naturally,23
15914,because I've reversed them so much,34
15915,honestly I just find lvm load and loadstring to be the easiest,62
15916,though stack and ci are a littler harder to spot there,54
15917,thats how i look for it,23
15918,you can also find 6 in coroutine lib,36
15919,mb gang,7
15920,well it wouldn't work for all of them though,44
15921,"I get 4 and 9 in lvm load, then 6 is partly in lvm laod and partly in loadstring",80
15922,for all of my offsets,21
15923,i should also make signatures,29
15924,"it gets the addies I need just fine, but the shuffles and encs are annoying",75
15925,and 9 proto,11
15926,6 you find in coroutine lib,27
15927,4 you find in luavm::load,25
15928,"I have a bot that listens for roblox updates, then when it finds one, it downloads the latest roblox, runs gogo's decryptor on it, and does a full dump",151
15929,"3,5,7 and 8 are literally just comparing a jumptable",52
15930,I'm doing a static dump so I can fully automate it,50
15931,"especially 3, 5, 7, 8",21
15932,you can dump shuffles internally easily from what i remember,60
15933,because the other ones take me like 30 secs to get,50
15934,"specifically 4, 6, and 9",24
15935,I want shuffles dumped,22
15936,i'm way too lazy to make a dumper,33
15937,and testing on next upd,23
15938,I'm working on a dumper,23
15939,just for fun,12
15940,and offsets,11
15941,but i'm still gonna get all shuffles and vmvalues for next update,65
15942,oh lmao,7
15943,tbh i'm probably gonna go do something else,43
15944,next update he'll be fucked,27
15945,good for him,12
15946,bro I cba to work on env rn so I'm just writing an assembly parser,66
15947,i bet unknown couldn't get them,31
15948,they're trivial to get,22
15949,i'm way too lazy to make something right now,44
15950,tbh after i got to the environment part,39
15951,Why are u giving them to randoms,32
15952,"who cares if shuffles are ""leaked"" üíÄ",36
15953,you can very easily find them,29
15954,they got publicly leaked anyway,31
15955,why what,8
15956,you can find like 90% of them with simple string xrefs,54
15957,"hehe, ~ you got away wif it, dont thouw think i wont catch yew next time uwu",76
15958,I'd give encryptions but they're all scattered across my code and I cba,71
15959,\n^^ shuffles for latest roblox,31
15960,only balkans,12
15961,I have shuffles and vmvalues,28
15962,won't work for you,18

15965,bro has not heard of shuffles,29
15966,i cant help you with that,25
15967,please don't block me bro i want some skids in my friend list,61
15968,you can't use lua_newthread  on roblox,38
15969,the initialization step adds all the custom functions and whatnot,65
15970,shut up or you will be blocked,30
15971,your language is a fucking undocumented function üôè,50
15972,like the flow is\nget global state -> lua_newthread -> initialize engine with new thread,88
15973,":3 uwu, oh yeh! custum funcs~! envs r so sexy, don't you think, boo? >:3 can i see the code u wanna make into a custom func? ^w^",128
15974,the env is initialized on the thread when I first create it,59
15975,envs -> custom functions nigga,30
15976,translated??,12
15977,sound fucking biggset shit with no envs,39

16111,"if yes so well, i am convert bytescode",38
16112,you mean to create proto and convert it?,40
16113,"and, what is error",18
16114,The state? The proto?,21
16115,And userdata for what?,22
16116,It's not even shuffled,22
16117,how to find userdata offsets,28
16118,"You tehnically don't, though its just scheduling a task yourself",64
16119,Task scheduler for that,23
16120,Don't you need to hook,22
16121,Or schedule the task through the scheduler,42
16122,Use task spawn then,19
16123,already setting,15
16124,For capabilities,16
16125,Well you need proto anyway,26
16126,but on the sec no,17
16127,on 1 execute this work,22
16129,its correct??,13
16130,Its very easy to find,21
16131,Search on this discord,22
16132,hm ok,5
16133,the steps on 2016 src?,22
16134,Two steps are missing,21
16135,Got any idea about it?,22
16136,"well, Luau::complile and compress and luvam and luastate and defer and lua_pop",78
16137,Also i think If you use  it works from the first newthread,58
16138,Who fed this guy,16
16139,once execute work but when excute again so error,48
16140,I tried to fix about `lua_pop(L)` but seem like that when execute i miss more something,87
16141,Test build,10
16143,"I saw 2 internal executors that also newthread from the env thread (thats also newthread from main), so i think its fine",120

16279,i was thinking,14
16280,then how do you know which one is getglobalstateforinstance / decryptstate,74
16281,I just get the globalState instantly via math,45
16282,to get mainthread,17
16283,Ion use any functions anymore,29

16328,on inject,9
16329,not including memory,20
16330,I mean on inject,16
16331,its not hard to make detections,31
16332,you can detect their metamethod hook,36
16333,well i know one for artemis,27
16334,detection?,10
16335,Guess ill make it for synz first,32
16336,and i thought this isn't one,28
16337,yeah its mainly synz nowadays,29
16338,i was on this,13
16339,yea to be honest no one uses wave,33
16340,as in that,10
16341,I need somebody to join my game to check smth,45

16385,all i see is 1 arg,18
16386,current jobid,13
16387,whats,5
16388,then look for that usage in IDA\nand trace back which variable is the state,75
16389,ok maybe try looking at how the state is being used,51
16390,doesn't help,12
16391,this one?,9
16392,maybe this could help you find it?,34
16393,uses lua_gettop,15
16394,take note of that `RBXASSERT_BALANCED_LUA_STACK`,48
16395,idk bruh bruh,13
16396,BUT STILL TRYING FIND,21
16397,actually unreal,15
16398,these guys will do anything except reverse engineer themselves,62
16399,i am reading the code,21
16400,not 2016,8
16401,do you have the  new  ?,23
16402,2 args,6
16403,look like that,14
16404,still trying understand where to find,37
16405,hmmmm,5
16406,physical memory moment,22
16407,yh ik,5
16408,instead of the offset,21
16409,you don't really need the function,34
16410,i mean you have to change the encryption every time,51
16411,I mean it's literally just script context + some offset,55
16412,honestly goes kinda hard,24
16413,and still doesn't find,22
16414,i tried challenge \ %s %s and smth else,39
16415,or be like the guy who remade the function in c++ for some reason instead of using the one from roblox,102
16416,ok good so search the strings in the function and ur good,57
16417,"well anyway, finding decryptglobalstate is the easiest thing you can do",71
16418,just look in the function,25
16419,I already gave him the function and he's asking which string to search,70
16420,no not really,13
16421,specifically,12
16422,the line,8
16423,would be me actually giving him,31
16424,well spoonfeeding,17
16425,just let it be,14
16426,bro you're spoonfeeding spoons,30
16427,"or yk, just look at any executor source that uses decryptglobalstate",68
16428,and then you can find getglobalstate based on that,50
16429,and do the same for a2,22
16430,i mean rename ivar of a1 to what you think it is,48
16431,"sub__(arg1, arg2)?",18
16432,or 3 args,9
16433,this 2 args,11
16434,you mean,8
16435,like find out what a1 and a2 is,31
16436,wdym map,8
16437,"if you can guess them, you can find getglobalstate",50
16438,i wonder what a1 and a2 are,27
16439,this should be 3 args,21
16440,which one it is,15
16441,to identify,11
16442,every one sub__,15
16443,well its not that hard,22
16444,im trying,9
16445,yues,4
16446,i dont find it,14
16447,though you still have to look for it,36
16448,but what line,13
16449,not the top and the base,24
16450,im talking about rbx__getstate,30
16451,ye that's what I do,19
16452,but its the same thing,22
16453,i mean i can also use lua_pop,29
16454,I'm already spoonfeeding you,28
16455,on ida,6
16456,I just re-use the same state,28
16457,im talking about string,23
16458,yeah then I have no clue,24
16459,i do that at the end though,27
16460,rbx_getstate,12
16461,what string for function get_state?,35
16462,just pop off the proto u spawned,32
16463,honestly willing to bet it's just ur stack being fucked after executing,71
16464,really weird,12
16465,its not because of that,23
16466,Then recode it,14
16467,Redownload luau src or some shit,32
16468,but idk why it crashes,22
16469,well i didn't either,20
16470,I don't newthread on execution,30
16471,for execution,13
16472,i do the same thing you do in any executor,42
16473,Holly shit what did u do,24
16474,So u newthread the newthread?,29
16475,and i have no idea why,22
16476,if i don't do that,18
16477,because for some reason it crashes on second execution,54
16478,then on execution i newthread from the env thread,49
16479,"i create a newthread from the decrypted state, register a env on it",67
16480,So u register it every time when u execute?,43
16481,U should register ur env on the newthread,41
16482,now idk if its good for optimization or whatever,48
16483,"i mean its fine, it keeps the same  environment even if you create a new thread",79
16484,Best code,9
16485,for some reason,15
16486,"but if i don't, it just crashes on second execution",51
16487,i have no idea why do i have to do it again,43
16488,And use it forever,18
16489,I just newthread when I get globalstate,39
16490,ON execution,12
16491,but now its fixed,17
16492,the issue i had yesterday was because for some reason it crashes if i don't lua_newthread on execution,102
16493,If u say so,11
16494,the vmvalues were not the problem,33
16495,Fix ur vmvalues,15
16496,it was something else,21
16497,i fixed that 3 days ago,23
16498,Me when shuffle 6 is incorrect and vmvalues:,44
16499,(without avoiding it btw),25
16500,Me when mine doesn't hit any trap pages:,40

16506,You need to reopen stdout,25
16507,Either allocate a console or use Roblox's print,47
16508,Gang this is unreal üíî,21
16509,sproute is gonna work on his kernel mode aob scanner,52
16510,after hearing this,18
16511,unless you avoid it,19
16512,you're gonna hit so many trap pages,35
16513,aob scanning is ass,19
16514,–ë—Ä–æ—Å–∞–π —ç—Ç—É —Ö—É–π–Ω—é,16
16515,unc is important too to support paid scripts with whitelkst system,66
16516,both,4
16517,OOOOOOOOO,9
16518,"ok so its not my env, interesting",33
16519,i thought levels are for those like u know the one on dex my fault im a newborn,79
16520,whats more important unc or level?,34
16521,or whatever,11
16522,which are also tehnically security context,42
16523,is what you want,16
16524,basically capabilities,22
16525,Lvl8 is where you want your executor to be because you have access to everything,80
16527,im new to all stuff,19
16528,yo bro is levels gained by injecting? or dll,44
16529,well thats great,16
16530,"actually yeah, most likely cause it worked fine before",54
16531,"also if I crash after one execution, does that mean my env is cooked?",69
16532,you can AOB it,14
16533,i can do print now i can now ccreate exslut 9999999 unc 100000 level bypass buyfront,84
16534,Yea it is,9
16535,but i think its inlined now,27
16536,its funny cause in the past there was a getdatamodel,52
16537,im not GRH GRAH,15
16538,why would you use that though,29
16539,Rename synapse z to synapse temu,32
16540,you can vftable scan and abuse getthreadcontext,47
16541,to get scriptcontext from datamodel you use the same method,59
16542,"also there are two datamodel methods, either renderview or get it through a job",79
16543,",",1
16544,Undetected until detected,25
16545,clang is honestly amazing,25
16546,no wonder always crash on injection,35
16547,"""nuclear retard""",16
16548,also if you got task scheduler you can also schedule jobs through it,68
16549,or synapse z,12
16550,we know u skid,14
16551,yeah ok cool,12
16552,does wave use data model too?,29
16553,datamodel method,16
16554,i used my own,13
16555,well tehnically faster,22
16556,waitingscriptshybrid is easier and faster,41
16557,why are people still using the datamodel method,47
16558,"even if you didn't copy+paste it, it's the same sht",51
16559,so you clearly took heavy inspiration from the incognito source code,68
16560,"yeah but you used the same exact method to get the datamodel, and you used the same exact modulescripts",103
16561,its just annoying,17
16562,I should start using clang for windows stuff,44
16563,is copied,9
16564,init,4
16565,and it run out,14
16566,sadly i have limited network like only 20 gb max,48
16567,it's like 10x easier than using clang,37
16568,I strongly recommend using visual studio though,47
16569,oooo my bad ty,14
16570,you won't find it in extensions,31
16571,where is it?,12
16572,I just use clang because I'm more of a linux enthusiast,55
16573,nah not really,14
16574,the harder = the better,23
16575,okay bro ty bro,15
16576,I personally use clang but it requires some more work,53
16577,okay ty bro ill just do it then,31
16578,either install build tools and use cl or use clang,50
16579,yeah but you're gonna have to build your code somehow,53
16580,aw nahhh,8
16581,that's called skidding,22
16582,ok you copy+pasted incognito and built on it?,45
16583,i just based on it,18
16584,like it's the same code,23
16585,you clearly skidded it,22
16586,incognito did it,16
16587,you don't need virtual manager in jest globals,46
16588,skidded from it*,16
16589,a bit,5
16590,on it,5
16591,init script is based,20
16592,this is the same shit,21
16593,incog,5
16594,copy paste,10
16595,you didn't skid?,16
16596,ok so you just copy+pasted incognito source code,48
16597,its inspired,12
16598,ded,3
16599,ewqll,5
16600,"if you didn't skid, I wouldn't call it skidded",46
16601,why waste time,14
16602,I call skidded shit skidded,27
16603,or pasted,9
16604,skidded,7
16605,and call every shit,19
16606,times,5
16607,100k,4
16608,quit yapping you're an embarrasement,36
16609,i dont do external shit anyways,31

16611,rejected,8
16612,ü•±,1
16613,thats how i knew the mtehod,27
16614,can i just use visual studio code bc my storage is low?,55
16615,of course,9
16616,from it,7
16617,self,4
16618,i just inspired my,18
16619,exactly the same,16
16620,this is 1:1 with incognito source code,38
16621,out,3
16622,you pasted incog,16
16623,marked,6
16624,maked,5
16625,just admit it,13
16626,looool,6
16627,why include it,14
16628,also old shit,13
16629,your executor didn't even support jestglobals,45
16630,ingame inject,13
16631,jestglobals,11

16639,"But honestly once you're confident in IDA, writing cheats becomes decently easy",79
16640,"like obviously you need to learn about stuff like injection, writing DLLs, and Luau",83
16641,that should get you started,27
16642,that's the roblox source code from 2016,39
16643,and yeah u can reference this repo,34
16644,for tools you want to learn IDA,31
16645,"alright so in terms of programming lnaguages, you're gonna want to know C++ and some assembly if you plan on doing IC hooking.",126
16646,I'd look here\n,15
16647,Accepted,8
16648,okay can i add u?,17
16649,"ok, but I can only do it tomorrow",33
16650,can u send pls?,15
16651,I'm just download it's from random web link,43

16653,How crack ida?,14
16654,im broke sadly do u know how to crack it?,41

16659,can someone give me pointers on what should i learn to creatre a roblox cheat,77
16660,üíã,1
16661,alright tysm,12
16662,and in some structs there's a blank space before the fields begin so that means there's a shuffle,97
16663,would never guess that,22
16664,o shi,5
16665,and shuffle2 doesn't exist so ignore that,41
16666,2 new lines = shuffle,21
16667,you can tell if fields are shuffled by just looking at how many new lines are befre the chunk of fields,103
16668,is shuffle pattern located in IDA?,34
16669,alright makes sense,19
16670,this is from 2016 but u get the idea,36
16671,those are shuffled as well,26
16672,those,5
16673,so its different than luau's headers?,37
16674,which is what roblox uses internally,36
16675,"after shuffling, it becomes this",32
16676,so you have for instance this chunk of code which is shuffled,61
16677,shuffles just shuffle the order of fields,41
16678,im kinda confused there,23
16679,is luavm_shuffle for encryption shi?,36
16680,ok and what wrong,17
16681,0 is normal and 1 is  info and  2 is warn and 3 is error,56

16932,they dont,9
16933,idk what you mean by that,25
16934,they work,9
16935,xrefs aren't fucked,19
16936,Sus,3
16937,"""wrote""",7
16938,im good,7
16939,i wrote a dumper,16
16940,youll need to get them again,28
16941,and if they push the update,27
16942,nobodys talking to you,22
16943,i dont need xrefs üî•,19
16944,is what the point is,20
16945,i needed,8
16946,and shuffes,11
16947,i found all addresses,21
16948,see if u get any xrefs,22
16949,and go to xrefs,15
16950,now try to analyze it,21
16951,cus they changed other things,29
16952,then why didn't it get updated to a11,37
16953,oh it isn't?,12
16954,client,6
16955,thats not the newest,20
16956,and at that point you could just dump it with a normal pe dumper like scylla,76
16957,but at this point you will need a custom game made by you to fire every single remote or whatever to get it decrypted,117
16958,"this works by always reading the memory, and when a page gets decrypted by a game or whatever, it imedietally reads it",118
16959,though i used fishys fork,25
16960,it worked for me on a11,23
16961,Yh but it's what the skids will use,35
16962,too lazy,8
16963,this still dookie,17
16964,decrypted pages are execute read,32
16965,yes i know,10
16966,but all pages are literally noaccess,36
16967,unless it does some other shit ive overseen,43
16968,so it just skips them,21
16969,no access,9
16970,the pages are literally,23
16971,You can legit get more pages decrypted via ur own game,54
16972,Theres better ways,18
16973,in a buffer,11
16974,it saves decrypted pages,24
16975,oh nah,6
16976,3 weeks ago,11
16977,cus it got released,19
16978,that it uses the same decryption method,39
16979,Im very certain,15
16980,this does,9
16981,is this nigga retarded,22
16982,if it doesnt decrypt pages,26
16983,what would a PE DUMPER do,25
16984,is he dumb,10
16985,I mean woffle rather,20
16986,are you dumb?,13
16987,ru on,5
16988,Vulkan innocence,16
16989,I can.,6
16990,YOU can't,9
16991,gogo's decryptor got patched on newest client,45
16992,skids gonna need to find a way to decrypt pages again,53
16993,shut the fuck up skid,21
16994,you cant unhash sha512,22
16995,Where is this hash?,19
16996,the coregui hash,16
16997,Cast the address of CoreGui?,28
16998,static_cast it to LPVOID thenu nhash it,39
16999,Hook the function that encodes strings to SHA512?,49
17000,SHA512,6
17001,What do you mean by the hash?,29
17002,hook the coregui hash,21
17003,Anybody know how shuffles are used for capability setting? I heard about this a few days ago but I don't understand how they can be used.,137
17004,you have to reinterpret_cast the uniqueptr then its ud,54
17005,is loadlibrary patched help me,30
17006,"Its not patched, but its 100% detected",38
17007,Ayo. Any1 knows is SWHX injection patched?,42
17008,but they are especially cause they made them for few games,58
17009,Altough yeah it's true that going kernel mode for aimbot is a bit overdriven,76
17010,True true,9
17011,Yes but your statement was that the aimbot feature/function itself was shit,75
17012,one error = one bsod,20
17013,Yeah but going kernel mode for aimbot is crazy,46
17014,or not,6
17015,Either its detected,19
17016,No aimbot can be shitty,23
17017,now the really shitty ones (lua scripters) those who are skids just paste from pastebin,87
17018,Yh but mostly now there like leaked aimbot externals most of them are shit and ratted,85
17019,Now they usually skid off github and chatgpt,44
17020,The aimbot ones,15
17021,have u seen those externals,27
17022,skid off yt,11
17023,now days they jus go like,25
17024,What people should search for:\nHow to get spoonfed by gogo1000,63
17025,What people search:\nHow to bypass hyperion\nWhat people should search for:\nHow to bypass gogo1000,99
17026,skiddy skiddy,13
17027,Hmm...,6
17028,this my yt channel,18
17029,thats because I do skid catcher,31
17030,the space,9
17031,look at,7
17032,AMA,3
17033,AKA*,4
17034,AMA USERDATA!!!!!,17
17035,at 0x78,7
17036,cause it has extraspace,23
17037,"i have no idea, i just know its a valid lua state",49
17038,you sure its global ls?,23
17039,thats weird,11
17040,and works,9
17041,the lua_state i get is valid cause it has extraspace,52
17042,or doesn't point to a valid lua_state,37
17043,its invalid,11
17044,and search for the offset that mainthread is at,47
17045,and when i go into it in cheat engine,37
17046,then i print out L->global,26
17047,"get script context from hybrid job, get global state, decrypt it, cast it to lua_state*",87
17048,what do you do again,20
17049,mainthread is invalid,21
17050,from the lua_state,18
17051,well me and another person cannot access a valid global state,61
17052,what problem are you facing again,33
17053,roblox is weird,15
17054,its still invalid,17
17055,and then cast it to a global state,34
17056,even if you were to decrypt it how they do it internally,56
17057,it still doesn't work,21
17058,from lua_state + 8,18
17059,well if you get it from + af8,29
17060,can't you just get mainthread from the offsets thing,52
17061,and mainthread needs shuffle5,29
17062,lua_State needs shuffle6,24
17063,why wouldbyou need shuffles,27
17064,confirmed them with tobias,26
17065,the shuffles are correct,24
17066,"shuffles, yes?",14
17067,can't u just find it via,24
17068,so g->mainthread doesn't work and crashes,41
17069,our global_state is invalid,27
17070,mainthread?,11
17071,like what,9
17072,though the global state is wrong,32
17073,well it is tehnically a valid lua state,39
17074,yeah you just get a different lua state but for wtv reason it's still broken,76
17075,hm?,3
17076,though i only tested it with 8,30
17077,even if i set it to something else except 0,43
17078,setting identity on getglobalstate still doesn't work,53
17079,we need a mandatory iq test for new members,43
17080,you currently have 4444,23
17081,your messages make up 16% of the total server messages,54
17082,"2% of all messages in hydra contain the word ""skid""",51
17083,cant be a skid if I dint skid anything,38
17084,Buddy buddy buddy,17
17085,shut up fiddle ur a skid,24
17086,Buddy buddy buddy.,18
17087,Awesom,6
17088,Buying right this moment,24

17092,"Erm setidentity(10) and setclosurecaps(, ""f""), 10)",50
17093,we all wish,11
17094,Guys when are we getting lvl 10 executors,41
17095,so if we pass 10 we get max?,28
17096,The global state being wrong is honestly so confusing,53
17097,*it should matter btw,21
17098,tho idrk,8
17099,u can try the different capabilities with this to see if u get a state with valid global state,94
17100,yeah thats to get capabilities from a specific identity,55
17101,so these are identity -> capabilities,37
17102,cause second arg is identity,28
17103,i mean yeah,11
17104,"so if u pass 8, u get capabilties 63",36
17105,ye it's calculated from the 2nd arg u pass to getGlobalState,60
17106,i will try it tmrw,18
17107,but tobias told me it wasn't necesarry,38
17108,i also thought you needed some capabilities to get global state,63
17109,maybe just try setting different capabilities and seeing if u get a lua state with valid global state,101
17110,oh yeah actually u can do like\n`scriptcontext + 0x110 + 320 * ((capabilities >> 3) & 1) + 48;`\nto get a valid encrypted lua state,131
17111,cause at this point i have literally no idea why it isn't working,65
17112,if i don't come up with anything,32
17113,thats like a last resort,24
17114,"i will just replace every single luau function with the ones from roblox if i have too, though i'm still planning on trying to fix global state",143
17115,so thats gonna be fun,21
17116,and i'm gonna replace them in luau,34
17117,Haha niggers has 1 iq,21
17118,my global_state isn't working at all so i will have to use lua_newthread functions from roblox,94
17119,i just want it to work!,23
17120,well anyway,11
17121,tobias helped me,16
17122,"then compile that, then ompress it to bytecode then whatever",60
17123,im abt to test rn,17
17124,what im gonna do,16
17125,yre,3
17126,why don't you just std::string then pass in the source of the script in a execute function,90
17127,it crashes,10
17128,but when i try using my thing,29
17129,and that worked,15
17130,that is in taaprware v3,23
17131,the dummy bytecode,18
17132,luavmload using,15
17133,i tested,8
17134,2 billion views,15
17135,hold on,7
17136,im joking,9
17137,why are you using taaprware's method of bytecode thing whatever?,64
17138,50038 replies already,21
17139,boht,4
17140,check verm,10
17141,or keep yapping,15
17142,u gonna send it,15
17143,i dare you,10
17144,2 pages,7
17145,im making a verm thread on this,31
17146,(it still doesnt work),22
17147,CONFIRMED!,10
17148,XSPY A SKID1,12
17149,i think i pasted it cs others didnt work,40
17150,uh oh,5
17151,but its ass,11
17152,in dms,6
17153,send me ur compress part,24
17154,yea i knot but,14
17155,send the bytecode,17
17156,yes i fucking did,17
17157,otherwise it would work,23
17158,clearly arent,13
17159,for no good reason,18
17160,# i did everything correctly,28
17161,if ->global isn't working,25
17162,well yeah i will try that instead,33
17163,i did everything correctly,26
17164,Ur probably doing it wrong,26
17165,so its,6
17166,yes i did,9
17167,of that,7
17168,just look at luau source and make ur own version,48
17169,my shit doesnt generate,23
17170,did you compress it maybe,25
17171,Thats dumb,10
17172,his bytecode works,18
17173,its cus,7
17174,i didnt ask that,16
17175,and then just recreate it in c++,32
17176,thats inlined in there,22
17177,"that does ``print(""Hello World!"")`` works but not the bytecode that i make",74
17178,like take the one from script start,35
17179,i try update taaprware why dummy bytecode crash my game?,56
17180,just look at luau sourc,23
17181,im trying to talk,17
17182,stop,4
17183,"also tobias after some consideration, how possible is to recreate lua_newthread from roblox inlined",99
17184,help help,9
17185,i imagine a ai generated voice,30
17186,why plusgiant5's dummy bytecode,31
17187,but everytime this man speaks,29
17188,i dont know why,15
17189,[angry~1](,10
17190,it was another one of plusgiants shitsploits,44
17191,yeah sorry,10
17192,im starting to think it was just a printsploit,46
17193,taaprware:,10
17194,Cus he never got a working product,34
17195,never came,10
17196,next week,9
17197,again and again,15
17198,ofc,3
17199,yea ifc,7
17200,it was supposed to release next week then it got delayed a week,63
17201,also fuck global state,22
17202,yeah ik,7
17203,They also do it on tables,25
17204,lolo,4
17205,i enver said it was,19
17206,his executor is releasing in 2026,33
17207,no it wasnt,11
17208,u were hyping it up so long,27
17209,when you'll die,15
17210,it was 100% unc,15
17211,bro when executor release,25
17212,"each struct/enum has values that are at specific offsets, based on those offsets the values get shuffled internally so that you can't use the exact order that in luau",166
17213,sorry this doesnt mean anything to me i use an efi driver and ida to inject my internal pasted from,99
17214,strings in tables,17
17215,or enum,7
17216,of a struct,11
17217,fields?,7
17218,shuffles 2 fields,17
17219,s2,2
17220,what is shuffle 2,17
17221,goodnight,9
17222,and shuffle2 got removed,24
17223,roblox is a rat,15
17224,the order,9
17225,like shuffle5 to 6,18
17226,or some of them changed,23
17227,they are not correctly placed,29
17228,im not asking for the shuffles itself,37
17229,uwp roblox,10
17230,with this I mean,16
17231,what are they,13
17232,quickly,7
17233,just not fully correct,22
17234,luavmload stays in uwp roblox,29
17235,So i need to get all of it to not get patched,45
17236,all shuffles are in the src,27
17237,thats where i lack,18
17238,good idea.,10
17239,the problem im not very sure what are shuffles in the src,57
17240,uwp roblox executor now,23
17241,Hhhhhhh,7
17242,no because 7 8 s9,17
17243,in the luau src,15
17244,which one is that,17
17245,where shuffles r used,21
17246,i know that one shuffle is in that boolean vector function,58
17247,you can find indications,24
17248,just look at luau source or roblox source,41
17249,idea,4
17250,so i can have a kinda,21
17251,where each shuffle is located,29
17252,can you tell me,15
17253,7 8 9,5
17254,or because,10
17255,because 7 is black?,19
17256,newproto is gay as shit,23
17257,why was 6 afraid of 7,21
17258,without luaF_newproto,21
17259,that I get manually,19
17260,what about s 9,14
17261,S3,2
17262,those I get automatically,25
17263,"s3, s5, s7 and s8",17
17264,the only shuffles I get automatically via my dll is uh,54
17265,leaked,6
17266,1 2 3 4 5 6,11
17267,but that would be a bit harder with shuffles like shuffle9,58
17268,You can technically automate it aswell,38
17269,wtf is happening,16
17270,I got shuffle 6,15
17271,Getting all vmvalues = you can automate,39
17272,Getting all shuffles = maximum 10-15min,39
17273,you do it in,12
17274,it depends on the order,23
17275,remember,8
17276,This will take long,19
17277,"its crashing for me when i use loadvm, maybe its because a wrong offset idk",75
17278,H,1
17279,ü§Æ,1
17280,youll have to update whole luau source,38
17281,"if you really want to learn,  or  are the right people",54
17282,EVEN WORSE,10
17283,or Proto Conversion,19
17284,not whatever this shit is,25
17285,i just want to learn,20
17286,there is a test build,21
17287,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,16
17288,have you checked the new version already?,41
17289,so whats up with my shit,24
17290,he contacted roblox support team,32
17291,New method?,11
17292,i think Tobias is a hyperion developer,38
17293,is that why i cant execute,26
17294,he's gonna kill us,18
17295,"oh fuck, how do you know?",25
17296,its a threat,12
17297,signed bytecode,15
17298,They are adding signed bytecode / with a key,44
17299,and larps,9
17300,this server is full of skids,28
17301,if thats what ur using,22
17302,you wont be able to use luavm::load soon,40

17313,yea surely,10
17314,ok? i do too?,13

17319,you wont,8
17320,go release a product,20
17321,I use that to find the func that uses the same arg,50
17322,boohoo,6
17323,deal with it,12
17324,now yuo see,11
17325,oh no,5
17326,in my ass,9
17327,when release,12
17328,where is your exec,18
17329,not with this skid shit again,29
17330,and tobias not?,15

17442,Its from old tut,16
17443,what you are calling,20
17444,you dont actually know,22
17445,cus you got it spoonfed,23
17446,It's a function that copies a specified number of bytes from one memory location to another,91
17447,honesty,7
17448,To be honest.,13
17449,google that up rq,17

17460,I don't have to tell you,24
17461,what does mem_cpy do,20
17462,Hmmmm,5
17463,what the fuck is this server?,29
17464,I make internals,16
17465,biggest lie of 2024,19
17466,you don‚Äôt?,10
17467,Do you even know the name of the first function you are calling to get a lua State,82
17468,I don't even make externals,27
17469,you still overwrite corescript bytecode for execution,53
17470,i hope not,10
17471,did they sell them,18

17493,his exec shit is level 3,24
17494,I'm not,7

17508,"I don't make exploits in python, and I don't make externals",59
17509,"Contributed, u pasted üî•",23
17510,you will get asked questions you dont know the answers to,57
17511,you wont get help,17

17513,Average pysploit contributor,28
17514,why would anyone think this,27
17515,Yesnt,5
17516,Isnt that exactly what ur doing,31
17517,cherpixel1 and pixelated are working together on internal cheat?,64
17518,Special child behaviour he thinks hes more pro than others,58
17519,im guessing he is making some cheat,35
17520,oh i see pixelated joined the server and asked if pipes were detected,69
17521,I dont do shit hes an nn thats why,34
17522,can i ask you something in dms,30
17523,You're both,11
17524,Skid = using open source stealers\nPaster = sells open source shits,67
17525,what exactly does he do with these sources,42
17526,what is with the skid bullshit,30
17527,I am a skid for asking some simple questions?,45
17528,You shouldnt be complaining about other people without looking at urself,72
17529,why ru talking,14
17530,ur also a skid,14
17531,Pixel is skid check his chat history,36
17532,this guy is the skid to you pixelated?,38
17533,who is the skid,15
17534,Pastes*,7
17535,skids?,6
17536,He skids every single source existing on this universe,54
17537,why call someone a skid,23
17538,Fym if hydra has 100 skids you are 1 of them if hydra only got 3 skids u are 1 of them if hydra only got 1 skid you are that person if hydra got no skids you are not alive,171
17539,You did that and you still turned out to be a skid,50
17540,No need to waste a year,23
17541,"I learned through a process of ""fuck around and find out""",57
17542,Ha noob,7
17543,alright I appreciate it :),26
17544,there are tons of videos on youtube explaining how game hacking works,69
17545,taking into context that you‚Äôre into cheat development i‚Äôd suggest you to learn how memory works,96
17546,making a calculator a simple game,33
17547,then gradually go bigger,24
17548,then make small projects like taking input and printing,55
17549,learn from it,13
17550,there‚Äôll be people explaining what to do,40
17551,to learn how to do i simply google it,37
17552,basic projects,14
17553,i made small projects,21
17554,what i did it,13
17555,dont use chatgpt,16
17556,ill tell you what,17
17557,god knows,9
17558,or you might resort to skidding,31
17559,you‚Äôll end up losing interest and leaving,41
17560,do not use,10
17561,NO.,3
17562,Aight,5
17563,well thats perfect because I dont know very much thanks,55
17564,it explains only very basics thing tho,38
17565,cheers,6
17566,it depends on how ur shuffle6 is defined,40
17567,u got it wrong,14
17568,"isnt it shuffle6(semi, ...)",27
17569,can someone point me in the right direction to learn C++ please,63
17570,cause its the same thing as L->global,37
17571,though why isn't decrypting lua_state + 8 and then casting it to global_state work,82
17572,getting it rn,13
17573,ill compare in a bit,20
17574,send me ur shuffle6 again,25
17575,lurker,6
17576,its still funny though,22
17577,thats random,12
17578,though why the fuck does it go to mousebutton2,46
17579,mainthread dif from original,28
17580,still doesnt work,17
17581,thats interesting,17
17582,"yeah ik but i'm just saying, its how i do things some times",59
17583,i'm the type of person to spent multiple hours on something,59
17584,that isnt my point,18
17585,"if that happenes, i'm just gonna fix it then",44
17586,all over again,14
17587,so youll have to find the issue,31
17588,whilst doing that,17
17589,and then break something,24
17590,I would literally do all this in C if I didn't have to use luau lib,67
17591,and then restructure it later,29
17592,but right now i'm trying to atleast make something work,55
17593,i could make the code better,28
17594,ive been doing C++ for like 2-3 months,38
17595,i mean true,11
17596,idek C++ tbh,12
17597,"i mean i mostly learned java, only started learning c++ 1 year ago while in college",83
17598,gahdamn,7
17599,u mean,6
17600,ugly code,9
17601,realest code,12
17602,i will try this,15
17603,don't worry,11
17604,I didnt analyze new dump,24
17605,itll take a bit,15
17606,its still *() - (),18
17607,imma still check,16
17608,its the same,12
17609,vmvalue,7
17610,which is at the first position,30
17611,its still lua_state + 8,23
17612,well even if i got shuffle wrong,32
17613,for global decryption,21
17614,but ill check newest dump,25
17615,I forgot to check,17
17616,like 30min max,14
17617,it shouldnt take long,21
17618,better to work with,19
17619,even if ur not finished,23
17620,I would rewrite it,18
17621,its still ugly,14
17622,except L->global,16
17623,most of it works,16
17624,apparently it doesnt,20
17625,it looks ugly as shit,21
17626,its ass,7
17627,you should remake ur whole src,30
17628,for mainthread offset,21
17629,either that or af8 is wrong,27
17630,I think ur just a noob,22
17631,to a valid global_state,23
17632,it still doesn't point,22
17633,how roblox does it,18
17634,when i get it decrypted,23
17635,yeah but ur a pro haxxor man,28
17636,how can you explain,19
17637,True for me,11
17638,that checks out,15
17639,it is 32,8
17640,its + 32 then i think,21
17641,you use a4 right?:,18
17642,ye that'd make sense,20
17643,i forgot about that,19
17644,hes not on newest,17
17645,its not + 8 for him,19
17646,lemme check rq,14
17647,so its 100% lua_state + 8,25
17648,they use L->global,18
17649,and its the first thing they do,31
17650,yeah obv,8
17651,ik for a fact its used internally in lua_newthread (inlined),60
17652,idk abt that offset,19
17653,then try it in cheat engine,27
17654,print it out,12
17655,with uintptr_t,14
17656,but when you use this,21
17657,well actually it should be global state,39
17658,hm wtf,6
17659,from what i can tell,20
17660,+ 8 is global state,19
17661,is that the right offset,24
17662,```*(_qword*)*(_qword*)(lua_state + 8) - (lua_state + 8)```,59
17663,"also yk whats funny, i tried it how they get global state from lua state internally",83
17664,well wtf now,12
17665,idk why though,14
17666,i also have this,16
17667,ok yep my global satte is fucked,32
17668,cant I just,11
17669,thats what i do to check,24
17670,has a valid lua_state,21
17671,and see if the offset for mainthread,36
17672,you would have to check in cheat engine,39
17673,as in L->global is invalid?,27
17674,maybe its not a valid global state,34
17675,idfk why,8
17676,this fails,10
17677,`LUAU_ASSERT(page->blockSize == kSizeClassConfig.sizeOfClass[sizeClass]);`,74
17678,but yeah this shit crashes for me,33
17679,u get the idea,14
17680,I just have this,16
17681,and then just vm_value1<global_State*>,38
17682,then just include offsets,25
17683,in newgcoblock,14
17684,for whatever reason this shit fails,35
17685,i just do this,14
17686,I can access L->global just fine,32
17687,idk how u do vmvalues but I made my own wrapper,47
17688,"weird though, cause i tried all vmvalues and it was still an invalid global_state",81
17689,or through the vmvalue,22
17690,do you access it through decrypted_global?,42
17691,Mainly because I haven't reversed stacksize encryption yet,58
17692,I'm struggling with some other shit now,39
17693,I can access global now,23
17694,mainthread still doesn't point to a valid lua state,51
17695,its still wrong,15
17696,but when accesing that in cheat engine,38
17697,"also not sure if you saw, but i tested it with lua_state + 8 using how roblox does it internally and then printing that out",123
17698,shuffle6 depends on update,26
17699,it should be vmvalue1,21
17700,i have the same problem with accesing L->global,47
17701,all shuffles r right,20
17702,yeah but that doesnt mean,25
17703,<a:Check:1178466082000994408>,29

18232,calls me skid or larper (its impossible to tell which one since he can never decide) yet he knows ruby,102
18233,im wasting my time here,23
18234,warn,4
18235,have you been living under a rock,33
18236,that meme died 1 year ago,25
18237,not skidding,12
18238,that is called larping,22
18239,u cant code shit buddy,22
18240,cant tell anything,18
18241,yeah because you're a skid,26
18242,i cant tell if this is ragebait or not,38
18243,it was hypothetical,19
18244,"give me a ss of me saying ""i got a smart role back then""",56
18245,ok then skid,12
18246,i never siad i got smart role,29
18247,then skid,9
18248,wheres proof of you having smart role,37
18249,no proof old server got banned,30
18250,prooffff,8
18251,i asked too,11
18252,old hydra,9
18253,i need a confirmation,21
18254,because I asked for it,22
18255,you got nuclear retard,22
18256,gang is this real üíî,19
18257,not having the smart role makes you skid,40
18258,i think its down syndrome,25
18259,he doesnt know the full story thats why hes acting like the special child of hydra,82
18260,i contribute dshits,19
18261,you were involved with a pysploit,33
18262,they only **think** of me as a skid although it is not proven i am skid,71
18263,**Boom! plusgiant4 hit a bomb! Game over.**,43
18264,everyone here thinks you are a skid,35
18265,quiet down,10
18266,you're literally a skid,23
18267,am I right chat?@,17
18268,I think nop does same instructions as jmp,41
18269,I wish I was as great of a reverse engineer as the developers at Celery.,72
18270,yes very smart team,19
18271,Celery is such a great executor.,32
18272,üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,5
18273,PRINT ISNT REGISTERED?,22
18274,skdi,4
18275,sure dm me,10
18276,can someone help me with setting capabilities',46
18277,"you're known as a skid, ratter and a retard",43
18278,do u actually beat niggers,26
18279,Link?,5
18280,crazy,5
18281,im not that famous,18
18282,Never heard of it,17
18283,"ok so i was missing a shuffle for freepages, though it still crashes at if (!page) in newgcoblock for some reason",113
18284,written in lua,14
18285,humorouscartel revamp,21
18286,What source,11
18287,i hope my new dev wont leak my source,37
18288,So it's worthless,17
18289,Also I don't use that shit anymore,34
18290,It's from plusgiant but ok,26
18292,so you got all shuffles?,24
18293,I got New thread do i have to get sandbox thread too?,53
18294,i apologies but it seems the previous method is no longer effective,67
18295,yeah it crashes at that for some reason,39
18296,it seems to crash at getting allgcopages,40
18297,well i have no idea why it doesn't work,39
18298,"I got new thread, How will i get sandbox thread",47
18299,I mean I keep updating  and I got no issue,42
18300,insane executor,15
18301,and sometimes it doesn't,24
18302,and not crash,13
18303,like it displays values,23
18304,also the more funny part is that sometimes it works,51
18305,Well shit then,14
18306,well i gave  global_State* and lua_State* to him and he said it was fine,72
18307,Ok maybe u patched ur luau lib wrong,36
18308,and he said they are right,26
18309,i also verified them with tobias,32
18310,And you're sure your shuffles are right?,40
18311,and he had no problems,22
18312,i verified them with tobias,27
18313,they are correct,16
18314,Vmvalues,8
18315,whenever i try to access global->allgcopages or global->gcthresold or some values of global it just crashes,107
18316,Bravo,5
18317,Crazy how you didn't skid the most obvious shit,47
18318,but i never skidded it,22
18319,So what's the problem,21
18320,yeah ur right,13
18321,ggggggggggggggggggggggggggg,27
18322,and they are correct,20
18323,i already have shuffles,23
18324,thats not the problem,21
18325,Like half of them are free,26
18326,Ok get shuffles,15
18327,i'm trying to make lua_newthread work,37
18328,well i'm not trying to set capabilities rn,42
18329,tells u exactly how to set capabilities,39
18330,literally look at the bottom of loadstring,42
18331,crazy how I managed to set capabilities without shuffles,56
18332,"""my capability setter"" bro you didn't invent setting capabilities",65
18333,MY PROFITS GO TO 0 WHEN THE PYMEM DIRECTORY IS GONE,51
18334,I LOVE PYMEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!,25
18335,Want a medal for writing a lvl3 shitsploit???,45
18336,i only know pressure machine,28
18337,the guy getting pressed,23
18338,he contributed to a pysploit and thinks hes a someone now,57
18339,"""nooo whyyy u spoonfeeding daddy master dont spoonfeed this skid"" ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫",70
18340,why this nigga so pressed about me,34
18341,to find it,10
18342,well he still has to look in luavm,34
18343,spoonfeeding,12
18344,nooo WHYYY,10
18345,"yes, and luaf_newproto generates them",37
18346,proto->sizep,12
18347,"i'm gonna give one hint, its in luavm::load",43
18348,dont i need protos like,23
18349,find luaf_newproto and then use that,36
18350,well you can set capabilities on protos withouth shuffles,57
18351,and protos,10
18352,i want to set capabilities,26
18353,id rather use without shuffles,30
18354,"shuffle8 idk, shuffle9 look at protos",37
18355,"shuffle4 look in luavm, shuffle6 look in coroutines",51
18356,by just looking at luau and comparing the jumptables,52
18357,"shuffle3, 5 and 7 should be easy to get",39
18358,do you know how to use ida pro to reverse engineer?,51
18359,and ive been making a internal for a few weeks,46
18360,i dont know how to get shuffles,31
18361,if you get all shuffles,23
18362,and also all of luau,20
18363,"well then try to get shuffles, it will help when trying to set capabilities / identity and you will have access to lua_newthread",128
18364,its just for self use,21
18365,+ im not releasing my exec,26
18366,"if you just paste and not understand, then its useless",54
18367,"you can be a paster, but atleast try to understand what the code does",69
18368,call me whatever u want,23
18369,"do you even know what's ""hop off my dick"" means",47
18370,i legit dont care if im a skid and paster,41
18371,now hop off my dick,19
18372,ok bud,6
18373,you are saying that word because you are copying somebody's flow,64
18374,no idea why though,18
18375,"also found something interesting, on pc the lua_State is usually 1 or 2, but on laptop its actually 3 or 5",106
18376,script kiddie,13
18377,u dont even know skid means,27
18378,yeah right,10
18379,i never skid shits,18
18380,u skid everything,17
18381,ur asking me,12
18382,u need the 2019 knowledge,25
18383,ur a skid too,13
18384,quit yapping,12
18385,no u cant lol,13
18386,u cant set protos,17
18387,both required to use protos on luau,35
18388,i will,6
18389,or just find shuffle4 and shuffle9,34
18390,i think thats how that works,28
18391,i mean its just find the newproto function and then set capabilities on that,76
18392,OH SHTI I FORGOT AOUT THAT LOLL,31
18393,also you have to still set capabilities on protos,49
18394,ok buddy,8
18395,special kid,11
18396,ED as fuck,10
18397,shut the fuck up beggar,23
18398,and earn it,11
18399,suck dicks,10
18400,is beg for it,13
18401,all u will do,13
18402,u cant,6
18403,its inline,10
18404,u cant get the new offset,25
18405,thanks for telling the problem,30
18406,AAA,3
18407,LOLLL,5
18408,WRONG OFFSET,12
18409,LOLLLLLL,8
18410,istg bro skids copied my shit now they tryna copy my capability setter,70
18411,public execution,16
18412,LMAFO,5
18413,THATS LITERALLY,15
18414,"""my code""",9
18415,pls kys,7
18416,dumb,4
18417,im the big dog here,19
18418,lmafo,5
18419,that skidded shit who used my identity setter,45
18420,only armandukx,14
18421,sssssssthedev didnt help',25
18422,he's trying to skid leaked misery source,40
18423,dont spoonfeed,14
18424,you gotta reverse shuffles to do newthread,42
18425,Oh.,3
18426,it's inlined,12
18427,as in lua_newthread?,20
18428,Address i meant.,16
18429,"Hello, i was wondering if how do i get NewThread Offset",55
18430,Ill check it out.,17
18431,but you can at least look at their methods and figure out what they're doing then see if u can apply the same methods to whatever ur dealing with,145
18432,first google result,19
18433,idk if this is any good,23
18434,Anyone got a bypass for it or know how to go about reversing it?,64
18435,"Yeh it uses a VM, just don't know how to reverse engineer it",60
18436,rawr,4
18437,Yeah it's virtualized,21
18438,"That was at the top of the script, but I left it out, sorry about that lol",74
18439,V14,3
18440,Its obfuscated by Luraph,24
18441,its been so long i cant identify it right but i know this is def some public obfuscator,87
18442,either ironbrew or 77,21
18443,it looks like a known obfuscator,32
18444,maybe it's some kind of VM and the encrypted string is some kind of bytecode?,77
18445,not sure what obfuscator that is but you can probably crack it with some work,77
18446,"Not sure what it's doing tbh, so I tried to decrypt it.",55
18447,I can give the whole code so you can check it out.,50
18448,"Not sure honestly, it makes requests to other files.",52
18449,You can just RE the decryptor if this is decrypted locally,58
18450,But is it decrypted locally or through a server?,48
18451,(The part given was a string),29
18452,"As the part is also being passed as a function, I am trying to understand what it is for.",89
18453,"For context this is a lua script, which I am decrypting.",56
18454,But this one section is encrypted.,34
18455,Most of the code prior to that was encoded to hexadecimals.,59
18456,and decrypts it locally,23
18457,unless the exe is signed,24
18458,"could be, but pointless to make it that big if you're verifying with an external server",87
18459,"I am trying to understand how the encryption works as it is run by a third party program, which I can find no public bypass for.",128
18460,"No, what I mean by keys is that the keys are being used for verification of purchase for example.",97
18461,and there is no encryption algo that I know of that takes keys that are a 3rd of a megabyte,91
18462,you cant tell what it is because majority of modern encryption algorithms represent the encrypted content in a base 16 string,125
18463,"Which implies you know, otherwise you would not respond.",56
18464,Ok thanks for your feedback.\n\nIf you would care to explain what it is I would be happy to know as you informed me I am wrong.,127
18465,gang this is so real,20
18466,-> know nothing\n-> claim it was ragebait,41
18467,yikes no1 skid comeback,23
18468,rage bait 1/10,14
18469,this is way too funny,21
18470,‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è,26
18471,because that encryption method does use special characters,58
18472,"tell me once again, why does it not look like aes",49
18473,‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è,14
18474,are you actually fucking stupid,31
18475,ok tell me which ones were correct,34
18476,a bit more,10
18477,only one was,12
18478,so what‚Äôs the problem,21
18479,but most of my statements were correct,38
18480,dont yap abt something you know nothing abt,43
18481,so tell me why it cant use special chars?,41
18482,symmetric encryption method,27
18483,do you know what aes is,23
18484,that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not aes,23
18485,aes doesn‚Äôt use special characters,34
18486,No dumbass,10
18487,what does aes look like,23
18488,ok then tell me,15
18489,that doesn‚Äôt even look like aes,31
18490,I dont think either one of you know what you're yapping abt,59
18491,that‚Äôs a good question,22
18492,how did you come to the conclusion that its aes,47
18493,and some other said it was using a shitty encryptor,51
18494,holy skid party,15
18495,someone said it was aes,23
18496,or some shitty encryptor,24
18497,yeah o heard it was aes,23
18498,or did you just ask gpt,23
18499,do you know what you're talking abt?,36
18500,holy skid,9
18501,"Nvm, I think its encrypted with AES, I assume it's a key or something",69
18502,+ the functions you need to set a protos capabilities,53
18503,You can find identity and capabilities in loadstring,52
18504,its in int not hex,18
18505,48 is not identity,18
18506,that makes no sense wtf,23
18507,By any chance would anyone know what encryption this is?,56
18508,Anyone know an api for Roblox executorsüòç,40
18509,I am trying to deobfuscate a script which has a lot of hexadecimal values in it\nHow would I go about streamlining it to find all hexadecimals and replace it with numbers?,171
18510,hlep,4
18511,YOu,3
18512,FUCK,4
18513,GG.,3
18514,if not u learn,14
18515,ur intuition will give u the answer,35
18516,check again,11
18517,Im gonna be honest i didnt read what u asked,44
18518,spoonfeed me,12
18519,Shut the fuck up nigger,23

18527,Airplane me,11
18528,Spoonfeed me gooo goo ga ga,27
18529,Check again,11
18530,Nothing,7
18531,What have you found,19
18532,not to say n word,17
18533,"we trained you better, we whiped you every morning to work harder and efficent",78
18534,im ur daddy,11
18535,learn how to respect your masters,33
18536,fat bitch,9
18537,because you can't talk to your masters like that,48
18538,He needs to first apologize,27
18539,n word is not tolerated,23
18540,apologize for what you said,27
18541,By any chance have you checked,30
18542,smart nigga help,16
18543,id assume they're the same hting,32
18544,theres script and basescript,28
18545,wtf is basescript,17
18546,"why is script a deleter2instance, you can't access them anyways",63
18547,48 is identity correct,22

18559,n n,3
18560,jew,3
18561,cant you read too?,18
18562,are you also?,13
18563,actually,8
18564,but its a good idea,19
18565,first step to do is change ur shitty language to english,56
18566,looks like nigger shit,22
18567,thjings,7
18568,why r these,11
18569,becasue of its shit memory managment,36
18570,it would like literally use 4 gb of ram,39
18571,nah but like,12
18572,That's like half a compiler,27
18573,I once wrote a luau parser in python,36
18574,luau rewrite in python,22
18575,Luau rewrite in k&r c would go hard tho,39
18576,but probably one by one but idk,31
18577,because feeding it the whole luau compiler wouldnt work because of max input tokens,83
18578,but idk how that works,22
18579,the only method i know is ai,28
18580,Idk about this,14
18581,With some caveats,17
18582,This exists,11
18583,only if there is one,20
18584,and then c to brainfuck,23
18585,translator,10
18586,you could do c++ to c,21
18587,you dont have to completely rewrite it,38
18588,Then just run some post processing to break up chains of instructions and the source is as good as lost,103
18589,"If I rewrite the Luau compiler in C, I can use a C->brainfuck compiler and have my code basically obfuscated past recovery",122
18590,and then unbeatify to make it actually work,43
18591,to have  lines works,20
18592,Ud for 1 day before patched by nemi,35
18593,but can you like beatify stuff in brainfuck,43
18594,intense,7
18595,Gonna write an open source lvl8 executor in brainfuck.,54
18596,WTF IS THIS PHP,15
18597,tell me its not python while telling me its not phython,55
18598,"Wrong. Most implementations of libc have puts, but it's not a native C feature.",79
18599,And compare it,14
18600,Look at python,14
18601,just change the keyword lol,27
18602,Doesnt look like its doing a good job,37
18603,idk how they can fail so badly,30
18604,like lua,8
18605,but ruby is mainly focused on being super simple,48
18606,C has puts,10
18607,"and they call themself ""simple""",31
18608,they use puts instead of using simple stuff like print,54
18609,Yet its always included in programming content fornaome rrason,62
18610,ruby is just another lua knockoff,33
18611,No one,6
18612,for daily basis programming,27
18613,who actually fucking uses ruby,30
18614,what is ruby even used for,26
18615,just behind all of these languages:\npowershell\nruby\nbatch,60
18616,I am javaphobic but without the aggressiveness if yk what i mean,64
18617,java might be one of the worst languages,40
18618,It scares me,12
18619,nobody likes java,17
18620,Please do not talk about java,29
18621,java has arraylist class and its like a dynamic array and it works like std::vector,83
18622,And thats basically it,22
18623,Like vector,11
18624,ok and maybe some other things that make it comfy,49
18625,thats just not the single thing,31
18626,Lets admit it we just prefer c++ because it has ::,50
18627,true c programmer ‚ù§Ô∏è,20
18628,I'm a C programista at heart,28
18629,I deadass don't use fancy C++ features ever,43
18630,I know the c++ without the goofy shit,37
18631,I do knlw c++,13
18632,but like how,12
18633,i mean it is possible,21
18634,how can you know rust without knowing c++,41
18635,Real ones use K&R C with -pedantic,34
18636,How am i a skid for using rust,30
18637,(while not knowing basic c++),29
18638,Rust is wild,12
18639,ultimate skid,13
18640,Anyways,7
18641,I use rust,10
18642,Imagine you have structs with members,37
18643,Ok idc,6
18644,It's less clear when u use uintptr_t for everything,51
18645,With uintptr_t,14
18646,Bc it should be the same,24
18647,Void pointers are fire,22
18648,What does that have to do with anything,39
18649,Ok what if its a pointer to void,32
18650,Especially when you have structs,32
18652,Roblox wouldnt even been there to begin with,44
18653,Just import stdint and use uintX_t,34
18654,An unsigned long long can deadass be 8 bits wide on some architectures,70
18655,For portable code,17
18656,Yeah don't use that,19
18657,The goat,8
18658,Unsigned long long,18
18659,Yes my beloved,14
18660,unsigned long long ‚ù§Ô∏è,21
18661,"I can make every variable a uintptr_t and my code would work fine with minimal changes, but it will be a pain in the ass to read",128
18662,I dont rlly care,16
18663,It's clearer when your code uses actual types,45
18664,and uintptr_t is mainly used for storing and manipulating memory addresses as unsigned integers,95
18665,so uw ant to specify the type,29
18666,Have fun,8
18667,because its an integer type and if you use it for pointers it can possibly reduce type safety,93
18668,__int64 has the same size of a pointer,38
18669,Ok idc to argue with skids,26
18670,Your code becomes clearer if you use the pointer syntactic sugar,64
18671,Ok say you have a pointer pointing to some internal structure,61
18672,That's retarded,15
18673,use uintptr_t,13
18674,why would u need that,21
18675,Whether you can deref it within your own virtual memory doesn't make it more of a pointer,89
18676,So a uint8_t* becomes 64bits wide on 64bit processors,53
18677,Scales ur variable up to whatever bitage ur compiling to,56
18678,Adding `*` is just syntactic sugar to tell the compiler it's a pointer,70
18679,whyd u call me out,18
18680,I don't get your point,22
18681,notice the * in _QWORD*,23
18682,and did u say qword pointer with the * is for externals or not,62
18683,def not ratted,14
18684,making free executers who wants?,32
18685,Using ReadProcessMemory is dereffing it,39
18686,yes you can deref a pointer that points to memory within another process,72
18687,who else got a gyat,19
18688,its just a number,17
18689,but can u deref it ?,20
18690,its like saying a key isnt a key if you're holding it outside the door it unlocks,81
18691,were u following what im talking about,38
18692,its still a pointer and still pointing to a specific memory address within the game,83
18693,just because the pointer is stored in the cheats memory instead of the game doesnt change what it is,100
18694,grow some neurons,17
18695,You're the retarded one here,28
18696,u should grow some neurons,26
18697,It's still a pointer,20
18698,That doesn't make it not a pointer,34
18699,not in ur memory tho,20
18700,its still a pointer,19
18701,the pointer,11
18702,Still a pointer?,16
18703,because the pointer is outside of ur memory,43
18704,So how can you arrive at the conclusion that pointers are for internals only,76
18705,u read it with readprocessmemory,32
18706,yes so external exploits can also use pointers??,48
18707,fact,4
18708,"That means, every external executor and aimbot/esp uses pointers",64
18709,"If you read a value from Roblox in an external cheat, you used a pointer",72
18710,yea thing is external exploits can also use pointers but its handling can vary,78
18711,and where do u come from,24
18712,He came in here and said the most retarded nonsense,51
18713,ass mf,6
18714,Idc,3
18715,they probably actually meant sure not in a sarcastic way,56
18716,Man someone put these skids on a leash this is insane,53
18717,external exploits also use pointers but their handling can vary,63
18718,"""sure""??",8
18719,You can have a pointer in an external exploit,45
18720,i said qword poitner ur retarded,32
18721,Gang you can only use qwords in internals,41
18722,Goes hard u gotta admit,23
18723,no problem luavm on discord,27
18724,"Thanks, scrunching for enlightening us",38
18725,pointer,7
18726,Insane information,18
18727,Gang you can only use _QWORD* in internals,42
18728,qword pointer,13
18729,that is for internals bro üò≠,27
18730,since you have direct control off cpu registers and memory,58
18731,that's true,11
18732,Literally ida decompiler output,31
18733,In k&r c u gotta define all your variables at the start of your function,72
18734,In assembly you can write to registers wherever you please,58
18735,Tbh variables in assembly are more pleasant to work with than k&r c,67
18736,real ones code in pure assembly,31
18737,Finna release an open source shitsploit written in K&R C and watch the skids try compiling it üôè,95
18738,Real ones code in K&R C,23
18739,dword goes hard tho,19
18740,dword,5
18741,can't wait to see _QWORD* in these guys' codebases,50
18742,i mean i guess,14
18743,looks like it was copied straight from IDA,42
18744,instead of the __int64 stuff,28
18745,yeah but you can just std::int64_t,34
18746,int64 is the best,17
18747,push 3A4 is this like a char or what is the purpose of this,59
18748,there's so many more idiomatic ways of doing it,47
18749,why the fuck are you using `__int64`,36
18750,not hard at all,15
18751,xref,4
18752,just fucking search `Spawn` in strings,38
18753,especially for spawn,20
18754,you're gonna do the reversing work,34
18755,ill give you clues,18
18756,alright buddy work for it,25
18757,And proto,9
18758,what offsets,12
18759,Can you give?,13
18760,Was reversing shit myself and got like 4/6 offsets for state,60
18761,ill send in dms,15
18762,dont want skids to see it,25
18763,I'll get to it later,20
18764,I don't have time rn,20
18765,best execution method,21
18766,try to write to replicator bro,30
18767,with that,9
18768,see if u can find the offsets I gave u,38
18769,"also i think i found findFirstChildByName offset, but idk how it works fully",76
18770,and it works fine,17
18771,thats the method i use,22
18772,Wtf did I do,12
18773,thats ass,9
18774,Oh fuck my ci offset is wring,29
18775,which has most shuffle6 offsets,31
18776,and from there you can find checkgc,35
18777,"look for cannot resume arguments (it should also have dead, suspended and other stuff), thats coroutines",104
18778,The stack/stack_last stuff,26
18779,21 can you do some for meeee,28
18780,Yeah but I can't for the life of me find where stack is used,60
18781,shuffle2 in question,20
18782,its just lua state offsets,26
18783,na bruh,7
18784,bc it doesnt exsist,19
18785,is the hardest to find,22
18786,bro shuffle 21,14
18787,Shuffle 6 is kinda a pain in the ass,36
18788,are the easiest,15
18789,"shuffle3, 5 7 8",15
18790,I said harder ones,18
18791,Shuffle5 and 7 are easy,23
18792,Shuffle4 is free,16
18793,i have no idea about 8 and 9,28
18794,the other ones I can get in 20s,31
18795,"shuffle4 is luavm::load (protos), shuffle6 look at coroutines, you will find most there",87
18796,were the somewhat harder ones,29
18797,"I think shuffle4, shuffle6 and 9",32
18798,let me check which ones,23
18799,(certain ones),14
18800,to look at luau source,22
18801,but I took my time for like 30min,33
18802,I also thought shuffles were hard to get,40
18803,If you look at luau source it shouldnt be hard to get,53
18804,When are you dropping your method for shuffle9,46
18805,roblox is only good for income,30
18806,Based,5
18807,outside of roblox,17
18808,Ill stick to games,18
18809,U gotta get into it,19
18810,It used to be good,18
18811,Ion like it,11
18812,Ive played this,15
18813,This?\nI,8
18814,(before npa ruined the game),28
18815,Bro has never heard of eclipsis,31
18816,no good games on it,19
18817,roblox is trash,15
18818,Idk I don't play Roblox too much,32
18819,Dunno what other games there are where people say their AC is good,66
18820,or Deepwoken,12
18821,especially their dick rider staff say its good,46
18822,although its fucking trash,26
18823,GPO anticheat is good,21
18824,people be saying,16
18825,like bruh,9
18826,so I highly doubt theres many use cases on roblox,49
18827,also ive never seen a roblox game with a good ac,48
18828,if its shittily written,23
18829,Tbh,3
18830,That's the only use case i can think of,39
18831,I would much rather Disable the LocalScript than use getgc,58
18832,You can just iterate over its running functions through getgc and break them,76
18833,if its poorly written u can just disable it,43
18834,Defeat any poorly written anti cheat with like a few lines of code,66
18835,never had a use case,20
18836,Getgc goes mad hard tho u gotta admit,37
18837,or getgc,8
18838,Ion use hookfunc / hookmetamethod much either,45
18839,I never got access to synv3,27
18840,when I had syn v3 I didnt use any new funcs they had,52
18841,I barely use any custom funcs,29
18842,Gang is this true üíî,19
18843,cus ive never used it,21
18844,internally,10
18845,idek what that does,19
18846,getcallbackvalue!!!,19
18847,you can,7
18848,and externally,14
18849,# no,4
18850,in luau,7
18851,you can make all custom funcs,29
18852,its possible,12
18853,Like bro,8
18854,Herm guys how do I write executor 100% UNC in luau pls help,59
18855,like this 999 nigga,19
18856,Thats what I think to myself if I talk to some people here,58
18857,Maybe they shouldn't be writing cheats then,43
18858,in 5min,7
18859,is not gonna get all shuffles,29
18860,a nooby,7
18861,So I'd rather spend my 5 minutes getting shuffles instead of rewriting luau funcs,81
18862,then writing ur own version of lua funcs aint that dumb,55
18863,but if u dont know how to,25
18864,Which gives u access to all luau funcs,38
18865,if you know how to,18
18866,You said yourself you can get all shuffles in 5 mins,52
18867,its 1 line,10
18868,to write ur own tostring,24
18869,Its not much work,17
18870,pushobject,10
18871,pushnumber,10
18872,But like why do all this work instead of just getting shuffles???,65
18873,pushboolean,11
18874,pushvalue,9
18875,I suppose so?,13
18876,pushing things to the stack,27
18877,Name one.,9
18878,if u cant get all shuffles,26
18879,also theres multiple use cases for rewriting lua funcs,54
18880,You also need the obfuscations for some shit as well,52
18881,not any shuffle,15
18882,It's quick and easy,19
18883,I said all,10
18884,To print whatever is on the stack,33
18885,You can just printidentity,26
18886,If you have no clue how to get shuffles,39
18887,cus thats what u do if u have no clue how to get all shuffles,61
18888,"Correct, so why bother rewriting funcs",38
18889,you can get all of them in like 5min,36
18890,Thought so.,11
18891,also shuffles aint hard to get,30
18892,na bru,6
18893,Then maintain it for every update,33
18894,See how far you get,19
18895,Ok so rewrite the entire luau lib with that mentality,53
18896,what am I gonna do,18
18897,I need 2 offsets,16
18898,2 offsets,9
18899,And said offsets are shuffled,29
18900,Still need offsets,18
18901,Right,5
18902,if u make ur own tostring u dont,32
18903,You need at the very least some of shuffle6 to get stack,56
18904,Don't I need shuffles for that,30
18905,or make ur own one,18
18906,u gotta use luau source,23
18907,theres no addy lol,18
18908,What's the addy for that,24
18909,"or you can just do lua_tostring(LuaState, -1)",45
18910,yes it is,9
18911,You can just check by calling it,32
18912,I'm not home rn,15
18913,so this is print right?\n\n11FE010,34
18914,what do you rebase ida too?,27
18915,that means roblox threw some error and pushed the chunkname of origin,69
18916,you can do `printidentity` and it'll print ur chunkname,55
18917,your compression is wrong,25
18918,"Hi guys, do you have actual internal offsets?",45
18919,check dms,9
18920,Well I wouldn't call it an executor but I can execute any Lua scripts I wanted on Mac and am trying to do the same on Windows right now,135
18921,Kind of,7
18922,did you make a executor ?,25
18923,"It's fine, just get other things ready for now",46
18924,13 is crazy,11
18925,same but I'm 13,15
18926,You only need,13
18927,It's free,9
18928,"i'm 16, i have zero earning",27
18929,Just set $0 as price,20
18930,i can't download because i don't have money,43
18931,Download the old Roblox clients first,37
18932,i'm back,8
18933,Probably because I have MessageBoxes right after every line,59
18934,have u tried setting breakpoint on defer and seeing what reads over it xd,73
18935,defer makes instantly crash,27
18936,spawn can't execute LuaVM::load in the current version for some reason,70
18937,DM me if you need help,22
18938,lua manual useful for me tho,28
18939,"also  im pretty sure they have shuffles retcheck, and they have int3s on random functions (which is handled in their exception handler)",135
18940,"Lua manual is of no help, the only resources that are useful are Luau source on GitHub and 2016 Roblox source",109
18941,He doesn't know anything about reverse-engineering or C++,57
18942,printsploit anyone can make,27
18943,You'll get confused,19
18944,Just start with a printsploit first,35
18945,"just find luastate, then find luavm::load like this and find \n\nauto lstate = globals::luastate;\nluavm_load(lstate, &bytecode, """", 0)\ntask_spawn(lstate);\n\nread this too i think it might be useful",200
18946,I was just like you 4 months ago and had to find resources as I knew nothing about this,87
18947,This will help\n,16
18948,You can download IDA here\n,27
18949,You'll have to make a DLL that can print to the Roblox console. There is a function used for this that you will have to find in memory using IDA.,145
18950,"Alright, I will go eat and I'll start this project afterwards.",62
18951,the old version of roblox exploit?,34
18952,it will work to print?,22
18953,A bit difficult since there is Hyperion,39
18954,Then after you have a printsploit you should make it for the current version,76
18955,"I recommend this, it has old Roblox clients\n",45
18956,i found it a bit similar,24
18957,C++ should be easy for you since you know C#,44
18958,LoadLibraryA and CreateRemoteThread are WINAPI C++ methods,58
18959,IDA is a program used for reverse-engineering,45
18960,"tbh i have no idea what LoadLibraryA, CreateRemoteThread, and an IDA is",71
18961,Print address can be found by exploring the Roblox executable in a program like IDA.,84
18962,You can use LoadLibraryA and CreateRemoteThread,47
18963,"Make a DLL for an old Roblox version first from around 2021, just make it print to console.",91
18964,Good enough,11
18965,C# and Lua,10
18966,What language?,14
18967,Do you have experience in programming?,38
18968,No experience on C++ and reverse-engineering.,45
18969,You have experience in C++ and reverse-engineering?,51
18970,I wanna learn how to create a roblox executor.,46
18971,idk someone,11
18972,who told u this,15
18973,i didnt know,12
18974,"Ofc they can, KM only makes certain stuff easier but they still can be detected from UM",87
18975,"there is no method, go reverse hyperion urself",46
18976,i thought usermode anticheat cant detect kernelmode,51
18977,"Well that ""someone"" is a retard",31
18978,someone told me that,20
18979,thats wrong in so many ways,27
18980,so it cant detect kernel,24
18981,byfron is usermode,18
18982,kernel injector,15
18983,what do u mean kernel,21
18984,and poolparty,13
18985,other than kernel,17

19117,every update,12
19118,no more long mode,17
19119,where u dont need to update it,30
19120,did u find the better one,25
19121,skell,5
19122,ye i updated the roblox-decryptor int3 sig,42
19123,is it the new int3 sig,22
19124,was that a sig or what,22
19125,send that again,15
19126,oh noes,7
19127,r these ur balls,16

19131,im currently looking into raknet,32
19132,ion reverse hyperion much,25
19133,what if I nop ur balls,22
19134,it would make sense if they did,31
19135,in this case they are actually nopped* <a:Nerd:1241179985008660591>,67
19137,about int3,10
19138,if u dont do anything,21
19139,why do you think luavm::load looks like this,44
19140,is that handled in their exception handler?,43
19141,they replace conditional jumps with int3 breakpoints to hide the control flow,77
19142,atleast not see all of it,25
19143,so you cant look at pseudocode,30
19144,wdym by this?,13
19145,decompilation,13
19146,to break,8
19147,why are there int3s,19

19180,theres a int3 lmao,18
19181,i found sub that returns luau_execute,37
19182,tell em,7
19183,tobias didnt feed me any addresses,34
19184,tobias or citam??!!,19
19185,oh we know little biggie,24
19186,cuz im him!,11
19187,why is the man in your profile picture fat?,43
19188,its a secret,12
19189,and who feeds him,17
19190,who keeps feeding you,21
19191,why is luau_execute's pseudocode fucking 8k lines,49
19192,trust me its not worth it,25
19193,you're too dumb to understand,29
19194,what does shuffle do,20
19195,i wanna post on youtube,23
19196,cus im bored,12
19197,i will now make tutorial on how to find luau_execute,52
19198,col,3
19199,Brb,3
19200,Of members that are used in shuffle9,36
19201,TRILION OF BOBOX?,17
19202,6 or 7 offsets at once,22
19203,Where u can get like,20
19204,:((,3
19205,But there‚Äôs other funcs,23
19206,Well no shit,12
19207,I was just looking,18
19208,There‚Äôs better ways,19
19209,Ye but it‚Äôs useless,19
19210,But I did,9
19211,Yeah see luaF_newproto in Roblox doesn't set all the fields,59
19212,shuffle,7
19213,Can already tell u that much,28
19214,If ur tryna find it in a dump you won‚Äôt,39
19215,Idk why u need luaf newproto tho,32
19216,0x4293D98 is luaO_nilobject ithink,34
19217,Just check luau source,22
19218,"Oh btw while ur here, do yk which fields are set in luaF_newproto?",66
19219,Idk didn‚Äôt check,16
19220,what about this,15
19221,But getting some shuffles at runtime is easier,46
19222,"U don‚Äôt need to, to update anything",35
19223,You can play on them etc,24
19224,you mean the client builds?,27
19225,"Not to mention the fact Roblox uses Luau now, not Lua",53
19226,does defer have retcheck,24
19227,Roblox updates are usually out for 2 days before,48
19228,"Looking at the Proto struct, it's clearly gained some fields, so I'd assume that changed as well?",97
19229,before the previous update,26
19230,how did syn z update in like 2 minutes,38
19231,On small updates offsets / shuffles and all that don‚Äôt normally change,70
19232,shuffles are shuffles,21
19233,Proper update,13
19234,Each update,11
19235,U just gotta update them,24
19236,Otherwise they r the same,25
19237,But that‚Äôs it,13
19238,are you sure they are the same?,31
19239,shuffle2 doesn't exist,22
19240,They are the same lol,21
19241,unless its an encrypted pointer to it,37
19242,idfk then,9
19243,scheduler is not a double,25
19244,yall go sob,11
19245,if it works it works,20
19246,we know,7
19247,-# i got fed the information,28
19248,classic xspy : ),16

19252,THAT RETURNS A DOUBLE,21
19253,plssssssss,10
19254,pin the getscheduler shit,25
19255,DOUBLE,6
19256,this is returning,17
19257,chat is this real,17
19258,bitdancer ratted me,19
19259,i'll send more,14
19260,i wonder why you're crashing....,32
19261,pin the tutorial,16
19262,idfk go ask roblox,18
19263,why is it dividing 1000 by a class,34
19264,you can see there's tls,23
19266,lmfaoo,6
19267,is roblox running a nuclear reactor,35
19268,"""thermal status""",16
19269,i think its 32,14
19270,roblox,6
19271,task scheduler,14
19272,there's also a pointer,22
19273,i believe this is common sense,30
19274,do not,6
19275,pin this!,9
19277,figured,7
19278,totally,7
19279,are you watching ur own video?,30
19280,let me get the string rq,24
19281,"on how to get ""getscheduler()""",30
19282,for skids,9
19283,video,5
19284,i made a tutorial,17
19285,it saves you like 7 seconds,27
19286,smegma,6
19287,yes but,7
19288,gang just go to loadstring it's in there üíî,42
19289,i have the ones from 2016 but i think its way too old,53
19290,do you have what the original shuffles look like,48
19291,and bytecode version mismatch,29
19292,oldref tihng,12
19293,there are 2 methods,19
19294,new to me,9
19295,not a new method,16
19297,Sempre,6
19298,"quando un italiano bestemmia, sai che √® un vero italiano",56

19300,then you need to pop stack or wtv you call it,45
19301,taskdefer(luastate);,20
19302,do your luavmload thing,23
19303,grazie,6
19304,defer is the reason for the unexpected client behavior,54
19305,and its not calling defer,25
19306,it gives unexpected client behaviour,36
19307,It works,8
19308,what you guys talkin about,26
19309,glazing,7

19316,they should be,14
19317,and i tried multiple vmvalues,29
19318,ru sure they r right,20
19319,it still crashes,16
19320,do u have vmvalues,18
19321,do u have shuffles,18
19322,I still don't understand why when i try to to use decrypted lua state in lua_newthread is just crashes,102
19323,are we on this version,22
19324,are we on version 43 something,30
19325,i just wanted to waste his time,31
19326,it gets called over that xref,29
19327,less than 5 mins,16
19328,i'll find it in like,20
19329,i am,4
19330,xref sub_A86050,15
19331,not you tobias,14
19332,you're a bitch,14
19333,the capability,14
19334,once ur gonna have to set,25
19335,if ur gonna keep asking ur gonna go nowhere,43
19336,ur just a skid bruv,19
19337,I cba to open ida,17
19338,to press Tab,12
19339,or ru just too stupid,21
19340,and see how its used,20
19341,do u not have like ida downloaded,33
19342,or just learn urself?,21
19343,Just tell me what it is,23
19344,in some pseudo,14
19345,xref of decrypt lua state?,26
19346,look at how it used,19
19347,can you just listen,19
19348,pseudo,6
19349,by now,6
19350,minimum 4 times,15
19351,....,4
19352,where can i find it,19
19353,how else is you gonna get luastate,34
19354,im p sure youd find it,22
19355,Is it needed,12
19356,What is 0xsigma,15
19357,Doesn't decryptluastate need just luastate,42
19358,sooooooooooooooooooo,20
19359,well scriptcontext is still mentioned,37
19360,faster to type,14
19361,"then to get L->mainthread (i think its what decryptluastate returns), i just do this;\n",87
19362,first arg isnt sc,17
19363,getglobalstate,14
19364,why do people call it,21
19365,encrypted,9
19367,That returns a decrypted state?,31
19368,you would of already done that,30
19369,like I told you to,18
19370,if you looked at the pseudocode,31
19372,thats for the first func,24
19373,Add 0x110 to scriptcontext?,27
19374,0x110 i think,13
19375,if its getglobalstateforinstance shit,37
19376,getGlobalState is inlined,25
19377,now maybe just do that,22
19378,to scriptcontext,16
19379,they add an number,18
19380,in the first arg,16
19381,what func r yall talking about,30
19382,when calling the func,21
19383,what r yall,11
19384,what do they do,15
19385,scriptcontext isnt the first arg,32
19386,"```\nuint64_t script_context, int* identity, const int64_t* script```",69
19387,"the args are script_context, identity, script",45
19388,If you'd look at the pseudocode youd know,41
19389,then what are the correct args,30
19390,no its not because i use mainthread,35
19392,Or x86,6
19393,I don't care about x32,22
19394,uint64_t for everything,23
19395,uintptr_t for everything üíØ,26
19396,only gay ass niggas,19
19397,also who tf uses uint64_t,25
19398,hes just not calling it with the correct args,45
19399,that doesnt matter,18
19400,for all 3 args,14
19401,as the type,11
19402,"`lua_State, lua_State*, lua_State*`",35
19403,u can do,8
19404,eh no i'll just send the funcs that im using,44
19405,with any args,13
19406,u can call it,13
19407,thats not what I mean,21
19408,i can send you my,17
19409,"It's not (uint64_t, int64_t*, int64_t*)?",40
19410,200%,4
19411,no you fucktard,15
19412,probably an issue with ur code,30
19413,cause ur detected nigger,24
19414,AHHHHHHHHHHH,12
19415,CRASHING,8
19416,KEEP,4
19417,I,1
19418,look at how they call it,24
19419,but ur not calling it correctly,31
19420,thats getGlobalStateForInstance,31
19421,to do getstate,14
19422,im using script start,21
19423,idk if im using getglobalstate,30
19424,ill look,8
19425,ok i think my shit is correct,29
19426,nga chill,9
19427,tobias gonna get pissed!,24
19428,call,4
19429,they,4
19430,fix,3
19431,so what do i do,15
19432,look at the pseudocode,22
19433,isnt this just,14
19434,but thats not how they call,27
19435,its datamodel,13
19436,getscriptcontext isnt waitinghybridscriptsjob,45
19437,of where they call it,21
19438,then thats wrong,16
19439,the address,11
19440,of the script context,21
19441,only return the address,23
19442,GetScriptContext,16
19443,Does,4
19444,where is the wrong part,23
19445,dont mind valid_thread,22
19446,well thats wrong,16
19448,this is my getstae,18
19449,I dont have any of ur code,26
19450,i read it wrong,15
19451,it doesn't call luavm_load it just crashes,42
19452,WHAT?,5
19453,it just crashes,15
19454,it shuffles the members,23
19455,it doesn't even call lvm_load,29
19456,the thing is,12
19457,before calling defer,20
19458,you would do smth like this,27
19459,0xC993E0 is my getstate,23
19460,shh,3
19461,is that lua pop,15
19462,Thats just,10
19463,what are shuffles lol,21
19464,r u serious,11
19465,whats that for,14
19466,i deadass dont understand,25
19467,i just need it to call luavm_load,33
19468,do this,7
19469,then smth else is wrong,23
19470,it doesnt evne call lvm_load,28
19471,well it would,13
19472,pop_stack isnt,14
19473,You gotta do it manually,24
19475,that explains why pop_stack is crashing u,41
19476,im trying to make basic execution,33
19477,lua_pop uses lua state struct,29
19478,do u even have shuffles,23
19479,like lua_settop,15
19480,all good,8
19481,what is pop_stack supposed to be btw,36
19482,defer 0xDF1E20,14
19483,lvmload: 0xA88610,17
19484,bro waht,8
19485,"send ur luavm load,  addy",25
19487,when i do luavm::load it crashes,32
19488,I do this,9
19489,"```C++\nstd::string bytecode = Luau::compile(Source, { .optimizationLevel = 0 }, {}, (Luau::BytecodeEncoder*)&bytecode_encoder);\n```",133
19490,tobias did u make a executor yet?,33
19491,to check if its a state,23
19492,is this corect,14
19493,theres multiple ways,20
19494,State -> 0x78 -> extraspace,27
19495,test on anyhting that uses luastate,35
19496,how do i check if i have a correct lua state,44
19497,am i using luau compile correctly*\n,36
19498,do i use luau::compile correctly,32
19499,i found it on some UC post lol,30
19500,normally,8
19501,but thats not what the func looks like,38
19502,no those args are right,23
19503,like const RBX::ProtectedString& source,39
19504,does it take any additional args?,33
19505,if u dont see that in there its not the right luavm::load,57
19506,show me yours,13
19507,frickle doodle doo,18
19508,out of the source,17
19509,this isnt accurate,18
19510,idk what to do now,18
19511,uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,32
19513,u get kicked if ur bytecode is wrong,36
19514,then ur bytecode isnt wrong,27
19515,no i just instantly crash,25
19516,do u still do,13
19517,when i mixed up 41 with 42 yes,30
19518,do u get kicked,15
19519,thats luavmload,15
19520,yes that's it,13
19521,inoti t,7
19522,me look,7
19523,doesnt luavmload args in,24
19524,let,3
19525,so this is the only one that looks useful with 4 args,53
19526,also i dont think my  compressor is wrong,41
19527,i just hope i figure that shit out,34
19528,Im noticing that,16
19529,Noticing,8
19530,everything,10
19531,glazer,6
19532,where did he skid from,22

19560,maybe by looking up,19
19561,ngr,3
19562,ur talking about compressing byteocode,38
19563,talking about a specific function,33
19564,were yall,9
19565,lz4 ong,7
19566,where do i find their fucking compress func,43
19567,I don't need proof,18
19568,how can i give proof that im not,32
19569,okay thanks,11
19570,Yap,3
19571,Probably is,11
19572,like the,8
19573,luavm::load has 4 args,22
19574,or ?,4
19575,are you calling me sigma,24

19578,Ur sigma?,9
19579,i dont watch homelander,23
19580,that's my dev,13

19585,a read write page,17
19586,you can literally just grab,27
19587,to write lol,12
19588,You dont need to deal with their IC,35
19589,it's really ez to get past,26
19590,they also still have the stub responsible for reading bytes and see if they match,81
19591,making compress func is ez,26
19592,üëå,1
19593,"its handled through their IC, they set a hook on KiUserExceptionDispatcher so whenever a exception occurs on that page it'll fix it and after around 5-4 seconds they'll change page prot to SEC_NO_CHANGE",202

19595,look at roblox source,21
19596,not in the correctw a,21
19597,not in a,8
19598,my bytecode is generating um,28

19602,on the normal pages,19
19603,r u saying i cant write bytes,29
19604,to write,8
19605,you dont need to remap or anything,34
19606,Theres nothing to get past,26
19607,it's easy to get past this too,30
19608,in the first place,18
19609,if he cant write,16
19610,am i waht,9
19611,but that wont do him any use,28

19613,"Yk, they have a stub which they call into and check bytes to perform integrity",78
19614,That wont do him any use,24
19615,It's really ez to get past it,29
19616,erm actually voicechat isnt there,33
19617,everything he needs is in there,31
19618,he can just look at 2016 roblox source,38
19619,are you sigma not skid,22
19620,Also hooking is useless,23
19621,(including the .text section),29
19622,they scan a few sections,24
19623,MY IDA IS RUNNING AT 1 FPM(ILLENIUM),36

19635,how is he supposed to hook it,29
19636,see whats going wrong,21
19637,he cant hook it,15
19638,set a hook on luavm::load,25

19681,how is xspy dumb?,17
19682,cus I barely learned anything,29
19683,and it wasnt that smart to do so,32
19684,I also did when I was new to C++ n Roblox,41
19685,relying on other people aint good,33
19686,I told you what to use,22
19687,vftable,7
19688,yk most smart people r retarded in here,39
19689,"see why ur known and not smart , lacking on the brainpower side ic",66
19690,did i say it was ur fault,25
19691,thats also not cus ur new,25
19692,if you cant read the luau source or roblox source thats not my fault,68
19693,no it does not,14
19694,ye it does nigr,15
19695,That doesnt mean anything but yes,33
19696,"sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry , quite new to this kind of stuff",86
19697,"Ios support, when ios executor?",31
19698,use ur brain and look at the args of the funcs that get called in there,71
19699,youll find luavm::load inside of there,38
19700,is one xref you can use,23
19701,loadstring() is not available,29
19702,to find xrefs,13
19703,you can just use luau source + roblox source,44
19704,do you not know how to read,27
19705,my honest reaction to this conversation,39
19706,if im the truth im the truth,28
19707,but you're not the truth so the truth is truth,46
19708,if you're the truth the truth is a lie,38
19709,no truth is truth,17
19710,truth is a lie now then,23
19711,i only truth,12

19718,see bro fixed,13
19719,cause ur a nigger,17
19720,Does anybody know why luau load can crash the game during the loading phase sometimes?,86
19721,C is my middle name,19
19722,u can create one nigga u just dont know hoiw,44
19723,is there any uwp executors?,27
19724,the only shit that was patched on my incognito paste are execution,66
19725,Then not,8
19726,mine still works,16
19727,I guess so,10
19728,incognito pastes are down??,27
19729,WAIT,4
19730,Now execute game.Players,24

19735,does this print hello world,27
19736,as &helloworld,14
19737,you can just give that to luavmload,35
19739,i just want a print bytecode,28
19740,nigga..,7
19741,someone else,12
19742,im having same issue,20
19743,im 200% sure its bytecode,25
19744,"Can I have a print(""hi"") bytecode compressed",44
19745,i want to figure that out,25
19746,why is ur luavm load failing?,29
19747,didnt plusgiant5 do this for TaaprWareV3,40
19748,"luastate, compressed bytecode, chunk, environment",49
19749,well bruh,9
19750,"No, just hook LuaVM load and see what arguments are being passed to it",70
19751,idk what im saying im fucking tired,35
19752,bytecode hook or what,21
19753,why do u need addys and offsets..?,34
19754,i'd hook,8
19755,correct addys and offsets,25
19756,if you give me,14
19757,im laszy to do that,19
19758,can you try hooking luavm load to see what parameters are being passed to the wrapper ?,87
19759,isn't luavm_load wrapper for luau_load?,39
19760,so nice,7
19761,ü§¶,1
19762,who didnt know that,19
19763,"therefore, im not talking to you",32
19764,you're not special,18
19765,YO ur friends with rainbot?,27
19766,is de4dot,9
19767,"the encoder for luau:compile could be wrong, if its not then i have no idea",75
19768,but i don't think tha matters,29
19769,though i pass the string through reading it from a imgui textbox,64
19770,and it worked fine,18
19771,cause i do the same thing,25
19772,well then idk,13
19773,that's what imdoing sir,23
19774,if you are using luau:compile and then compressing the bytecode,63
19775,ITS THE BYTECODE,16
19776,ADDYS,5
19777,THE,3
19778,NOT,3
19779,BYTE CODE,9
19780,its the bytecode that is incorrect,34
19781,and taskdefer is correct offset?,32
19782,its not popstack,16
19783,yes monkey,10
19785,the dummy bytecode i took from taaprware v3 worked perfectly fine,65
19786,are you doing pop stack using 0x10,34
19787,yea its my bytecode idk,23
19788,incorrect (??),14
19789,meaning the bytecode is,23
19790,i crash,7
19791,taskdefer(luastate) then popstack,33
19792,like um,7
19793,do my shit,10
19794,but when i,10
19795,i tried  and it returned (success),34
19796,"i fixed it, it was bad compression",34
19797,i never got this error code,27
19798,finally bad compression error came out,38
19799,imma go eat,11
19800,im tired of this shit,21
19801,yea my compressor is shit,25
19802,meaning its zstd and xxhash,27
19803,and my compressor is fine,25
19804,meaning its my compressor,25
19805,the compile one works,21
19806,idk why my compress thing wouldnt work,38
19807,maybe my files are shit?,24
19808,the same,8
19809,there should be,15
19810,also the  file,14
19811,can you send your  and  files,29
19812,just like in your code,22
19813,and the other two are 41 and 42,31
19814,magic is RSB1,13
19815,kBytecodeMagic kBytecodeHashSeed kBytecodeHashMultiplier,56
19816,so it doesn't matter that much,30
19817,but its the same anyway,23
19818,also its literally just stolen from somwhere,44
19820,is this even correct,20
19821,this is my compressor,21
19823,idk why i said method,21
19824,function,8
19825,compress shit,13
19826,can you give me,15
19827,runs on scheduler,17
19828,it was my compression,21
19829,i knew it bro,13
19830,i love you,10
19831,OMGGG,5
19832,I DID IT,8
19833,AHH,3
19834,also  should work with luavmload,32
19835,from what i remember,20
19836,is better,9
19837,great,5
19838,and when cast to one it just works,34
19839,but i never tried to cast it to a lua_State*,44
19840,Funny how i tried before getting G->mainthread (cause mainthread is in global_State*) and it always returns 0,109
19841,"which is better,  or",20
19842,or would i need to use,22
19843,if luavmload worked then task defer should have worked too,58
19844,i got correct function shit and correct address,47
19845,i just crash,12
19846,also when i \n,14
19847,it works \n\n,13
19848,it keeps returning nothing,26
19849,"int status = luavm_load(Lua_State, &Executable, ""=Script"", 0);\n\n    if (status == 0)\n    {\n        print(1, ""Ye"");\n    }",125
19850,itll return 0,13
19851,does that mean its correct,26
19852,now luavmload returned nothing,30
19854,does this look right,20
19856,I think 1 means luau error,26
19857,i bet its compression,21
19858,ooooooohhhhhhh,14
19859,then its an error yes,21
19860,if luavm load doesnt return 0,29
19861,like bad compression?,21
19862,is 3 an error,13
19863,try to print the error,22
19864,is dis corekt,13
19867,what is ur return type,22
19868,in ur luavm load definition,27
19869,what type,9

19871,what ru using as the return,27
19873,question : WHY THE FUCK LUAVMLOAD RETURNS 3,43

19974,i finished it 3 times,21
19975,Translate it yourself.,22

19977,how do you knwo,15
19978,You may need to manualy add it.\nThough I am not 100% sure.,59
19979,So they understand you.,23
19980,Btw they speak english but don't want to.,41
19981,I wouldn't translate what they said,35
19982,das strange. did you set the linker to look to that folder?,59
19983,She is there,12
19984,but it just look like ur missing  so get that and drag it into the same folder as,81

20045,comparing at runtime is easier,30
20046,shut up pulsaros,16
20047,but shuffles are legit macros u wouldnt know,44
20048,rn i managed to get closure somehow,35
20049,and set shitty capabilities,27
20050,im trying to find protos,24
20051,fucking around,14
20052,what are you doing,18
20053,"If you find any bugs, please try to reproduce them with `/decompile-source` so they can be fixed easily",103
20054,thanks!,7
20055,enums use comma,15
20056,wow really?,11
20057,no lmfao,8
20058,for all of them,15
20059,you need the semicolon,22
20060,meaning i'll need ;,19
20061,it says enum,12
20062,its a state,11
20063,duh,3
20064,its obviously a enum,20
20065,->k\n->code\n->p\n->codeentry,29
20066,i will try proto then,21
20067,but its fine ig,15
20068,its annoying to find the ones that you need to compare with the original luau,77
20069,easiest way is proto,20
20070,with my current way,19
20071,i now how to easily find them,29
20072,cus I wanna test if I can get all the shuffles,46
20073,well atleast now,16
20074,ok last one to find is shuffle4,31
20075,dont say that,13
20076,no stop,7
20077,luastate is struct yes,22
20078,Hopefully update today,22
20079,comma in enums,14
20080,semicolon in structs,20
20081,"luavm_shuffle6(;, blablabla)",28
20082,i just do um,12
20083,",",1
20084,oh like,7
20085,umm,3
20086,depending on where its used,27
20087,but the seperator is different,30
20088,epic,4
20089,"#define LUAVM_SHUFFLE6(s, a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5) a1 s a0 s a3 s a5 s a4 s a2",77
20090,other ones I just dump automatically,36
20091,"shuffle4, 6 and 9 I get via offsets",35
20092,but i want to do it myself,26
20093,in my text,10
20094,in the order,12
20095,I literally wrote it,20
20096,broski,6
20097,fforgot,7
20098,i need to compare them to that,30
20099,a1 a0 a3 a5 a4 a2,17
20100,should be correct,17
20101,a2 s a1 s a4 s a6 s a5 s a3,27
20102,whats correct shuffle4?,23
20103,how to find every shuffle and offset in IDA,43
20104,I wrote a huge .txt,19
20105,why the fuck didn't i just go for that,38
20106,i did see +32 on ida,20
20107,now that i think about it,25
20108,Sadge,5
20109,ok i was so close,17
20111,so stack is 48?,15
20112,well that makes more sense now,30
20113,that stack is wrong,19
20114,it goes until 48,16
20115,yeah i was right,16
20116,why would shuffle6 go until 104,31
20117,well yeah top and base should be correct,40
20118,top and base are corect,23
20119,what ru on about,16
20120,i'm not sure on stack,21
20121,rn ?,4
20122,for the offsets,15
20123,also is this almost correct?,28
20124,strings,7
20125,yeah but thats not as easy to compare as uh,43
20126,well actually its table,23
20127,shuffle4 anymore,16
20128,doesnt use,10
20129,lua_type,8
20130,also metatable,14
20131,man what's a boolean,20
20132,Imma see if I can find lua_type,31
20133,lua_Type,8
20134,ig you can get shuffled5 from __metatable still so thats why it was right,73
20135,why my shuffle4 was wrong,25
20136,so that makes sense,19
20137,OH NO NOT PROTO!!!!!!!!!!!,26
20138,then where is shuffle4,22
20139,wait a minute,13
20140,"is it \n#define LUAVM_SHUFFLE_COMMA ,",37
20141,luavmshufflecomma?,18
20142,its shuffle5 now,16
20143,that doesnt exist anymore,25
20144,it should be a3 a1 a4 a2,24
20145,"yeah its from table, function, userdata, thread",47
20146,guess I can add 4,17
20147,oh ic,5
20148,let me look at src rq,21
20149,I only get 3 5 7 and 8,22
20150,whered u get 4 from though,26
20151,shuffle 3 and 4 are in type names,33
20152,and shuffle 7 aswell,20
20153,shuffle 5 is in lua event,25
20154,u cant find all shuffles in there,33
20155,because of lua_typenames,24
20156,"well yeah ik shuffle 3, 4, 5 and 7 can be auto updated",54
20157,an example of what I do,23
20158,but ig runtime would be better,30
20159,i also could get them from a normal static decrypted dump from gogo github,74
20160,for that,8
20161,and runtime is the best way,27
20162,that is the only way,20
20163,through*,8
20164,well i got them thorugh comparing,33
20165,like shuffle3,13
20166,also shuffle5 has a similar way to do it,40
20167,you dont need to look at the disassembly for any,48
20168,at runtime,10
20169,u can dump all shuffles,23
20170,not true,8
20171,-10002,6
20172,oh okay,7
20173,i know that lone's offset dumper works on capstone,50
20174,does capstone still work on dumps,33
20175,you can recreate luau source,28
20176,and i have no idea for 6,24
20177,ohhhhh,6
20178,so you have to compare it in dissasembly,40
20179,"and for shuffle5 you do it with __concat, remember though that it doesn't have a jumptable for event names",106
20180,"userdata, table, thread and function, compare with original and then you get shuffle4",85
20181,dude thanks,11
20182,you do the same for shuffle4,28
20183,holy shit now I understand,26
20184,OHHHH,5
20185,so its a1 a3 a2,15
20186,and there vector and number are swapped,39
20187,"well userdata is first, number is second and vector is third in luau",68
20188,can't I just guess the orders,29
20189,shuffle 3 is a2 a1 a3,21
20190,you then get the original order from luau and compare it to those,65
20191,"so for example cases 2,3 and 4 are userdata, vector and number that are shuffled in shuffle3",92
20192,um,2
20193,then you compare the values that are shuffled in luau to the ones there,71
20194,go to the one that has 1 through 9 or whatever it was,53
20195,you will find a jumptable,25
20196,then xref to that,17
20197,"well search for any lua type like fuction, thread whatever in strings",69
20198,I got a dump already,20
20199,guidance?!,10
20200,mind giving me a little,23
20201,yeah but idk how to get it from there yet,41
20202,yea 6 is luastate,17
20203,"6 is luastate, no?",18
20204,by looking at the luau source,29
20205,how do you figure out the order,31
20206,6 i have no idea how to get yet,31
20207,in dumped roblox,16
20208,and events,10
20209,you can get them by comparing lua types,39
20210,I know how to use them I just don't know how to find them,57
20211,"i have 3, 4 and 5, they are probably correct",44
20212,3456 is what I need rn,22
20213,use luau,8
20214,what can you do with shuffles,29
20215,not types,9
20216,well ok 5 is lua event names,28
20217,idk about 6 though,18
20218,"ok found out later you can find 3, 4 and 5 by comparing lua types",65
20219,I'll send you code in dms,25
20220,are you serious,15
20221,how does substraction encryption work,37
20222,nah but fr,10
20223,ida pro sucks,13
20224,i got the offsets i just don't know how to calculate the substraction,69
20225,cp?,3
20226,child protos,12
20227,pp,2
20228,what is p->p guys,17
20229,skibidilined,12
20230,its noinline!,13
20231,probably yes,12
20232,is pseudo2addr (by address) inlined,35
20233,I need entertainment,20
20234,yea I wanted to see him get mad,31
20235,he knows whats about to happen,30
20236,grh wana go dms,15
20237,yuh uh,6
20238,and main L should be our own thread using lua_newthread,55
20239,sandbox ls\nuse ls\n\nsandbox ls again\nuse ls again\n\netc,59
20240,so I just keep sandboxing,25
20241,on new states,13
20242,and then i also sandbox it for each execution,45
20243,(this is done during first cloning of global state),51
20244,yes ok,6
20245,you need to luaL_sandboxthread(L); on each execution,52
20246,aka globaltable,15
20247,and for getgenv I push ls_gt,28
20248,sow e do need to sandbox our new thread,39
20249,yes ok so I was right,21
20250,then its kinda shitty,21
20251,but if your exploit doesnt sandbox it,37
20252,which should be sandboxed for each execution,44
20253,u will push the L->gt,21
20254,pushing index (-10002) rather than pushing LUA_GLOBALSINDEX,59
20255,isn't it the same,17
20256,for shitty implementation of it,31
20257,for getgenv,11
20258,do i*,5
20259,so I just push LUA_GLOBALSINDEX,31
20260,grr,3
20261,gae,3
20262,I miss clicked 3,16
20263,it's 2 not 3,12
20264,it's 2 not 2,12
20265,no -10002,9
20266,global environment index is -10003,34
20267,questjon: isn't luastate a closure?,35
20268,good luck on that lmao,22
20269,meanwhile current shit is like this:,36
20270,lua 's  from 2015L (roblox-hitius-sourcecode) is like this :,60
20271,im retarded,11
20272,you do smth,11
20273,whilst roblox is running,24
20274,what is runtime,15
20275,runtime is better for 3 and 5,29
20276,dump of roblox?,15
20277,go find it urself,17
20278,3 and 5,7
20279,what do i need to look at to find the easy ones,47
20280,ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,26
20281,ur gonna struggle on,20
20282,according to people that knows how to get them,46
20283,arent they easy to find,23
20284,3 4 5 6,7
20285,im checking,11
20286,3 5 6,5
20287,can u wait,10
20288,thats it?,9
20289,shuffle5,8
20290,what shuffles do i need for,27
20291,i only want luastate,20
20292,fuck proto,10
20293,WHCIHC ONE!?1,13
20294,the other ones are somewhat harder,34
20295,theres 4 you can easily get,27
20296,thought u only meant luastate,29
20297,found one shuffle lmao,22
20298,the struct,10
20299,globpalstate is in,18
20300,that r shuffled in globalState,30
20301,that it accesses some things,28
20302,ok i just need to update,24
20304,and why do I gotta do 10 of them,32
20305,why are there so many options,29
20306,its recommended from what i remember,36
20307,is sandboxing really needed,27
20308,and bla bla bla,15
20309,luanewthread(mainthread)\nsandboxthread on newthread,52
20310,and have a reference,20
20311,and register funcs there,24
20312,what exploits do is make a newthread,36
20313,roblo,5
20314,roblox and lua globals,22
20315,getgenv will return,19
20316,on mainthread,13
20317,i cant make custom funcs on mainthread?!?!,42
20318,if you register custom funcs,28
20319,custom funcs,12
20320,no yea i know i can but why do i not want to,44
20321,u just dont want to,19
20322,why do i NOT use mainthread on luavmload?,41
20323,wait update will come soon,26
20324,i pay 101 robux for current shuffles,36
20325,or offsets,10
20326,its just comparing values,25
20327,theres no method,16
20328,take it or leave,16
20329,i will pay 100 robux if you give me method to find shuffles because im REALLY outdated,86
20330,well time to get shuffles ig,28
20331,so i was right,14
20332,CommonHeader,12
20333,isnt that all,13
20334,shuffle6 on top till stack\nshuffle 3 on gt till gclist,55
20335,important,9
20336,s3 most,7
20337,ok so shuffle2 existed but now its gone i think,47
20338,didnt really check,18
20339,maybe it accesses shit that isnt shuffled,41
20341,global state,12
20342,idont,5
20343,globalState,11
20344,i don't use and it works,24
20345,u use shuffle 5,15
20346,im checking rn,14
20347,you also need 5,15
20348,for newthread,13
20349,lua state,9
20350,not for,7
20351,you need more than 6 and 3,26
20352,( i think ),11
20353,shuffled,8
20354,commonheader,12
20355,let me check luau src rq,24
20356,global,6
20357,and on,6
20358,vmvalue on stacksize,20
20359,for lua state,13
20360,6 and 3,7
20361,63,2
20362,just 6?,7
20363,six,3
20364,xi,2
20365,sechs,5
20366,what shuffle do i need for lua_newthread,40
20367,ok tobias,9
20368,somehow,7
20369,and my shit,11
20370,i use only 4 times,18
20371,im not too sure if thats all,28
20372,ermm,4
20373,Atleast 25 places I know of,27
20374,where vmvalues r used,21
20375,theres 25 places,16
20376,vmvalue1\nvmvalue2\nvmvalue3\nvmvalue4,38
20377,but theres tons of places,25
20378,That works yeah,15
20379,theres 4 encs,13
20380,EZ!,3
20381,SWITHC NUMBERS SINCE YOU GOT CODE!,34
20382,till it works,13
20383,just do the retard method and try everything,44
20384,most of the time,16
20385,itll get decrypted (or itll get encrypted) there,48
20386,is accessed,11
20387,u just gotta look at where,26
20388,its not hard to find out the encryption,39
20389,ate,3
20390,ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,68
20391,i teached myself how to upd,27
20392,oh so i just need to figure out what type,41
20393,changes every upd,17
20394,the encryption that is used,27
20395,it changed,10
20396,or does it change every update?,31
20397,outdated,8
20398,so the encryption for global is ADD?,36
20399,"in this codebase, is vmvalue1;\nADD\nSUB\nXOR\nSUB1 (??)",56
20400,tobias does not spoonfeed i think,33
20401,i just want shuffles!,21
20402,tobias can you teach me..,25
20403,but L->global is also encrypted,31
20404,im pretty sure it has,21
20405,shuffle6 has l->global,22
20406,i struggle to get protos üò≠,26
20407,which is inside of a shuffle + encrypted,40
20408,so we need shuffle6!,20
20409,it's,4
20410,lua_newthread accesses,22
20411,how this works,14
20412,VMVALUES?,9
20413,i got smart,11
20414,also vmvalues,13
20415,so i am forced to use shuffles if i want to have an environment,63
20416,p sure,6
20417,inlined on the client,21
20418,inlined,7
20419,cant i use address of lua_newthread,35
20420,to use the lua_newthread,24
20421,using,5
20422,but u gotta do,14
20423,this is correct,15
20424,newthread = lua_newthread(mainthread);\nthen i do the shit that i need to do,76
20425,istg,4
20426,smart role,10
20427,y'all needa give me,19
20428,!!!!!!!,7
20429,can you give tobias the role he deserves,40
20430,vrry smart,10
20431,use as a execution state,24
20432,is what you would want to ideally,33
20433,lua_newthread,13
20434,yes but u dont want to,22
20435,luavmload?,10
20436,and we can use mainthread tooooo,32
20437,would return mainthread,23
20438,then calling decryptluastate on that,36
20439,yes that,8
20440,it returns an encrypted lua state,33
20441,pls dont shit on me üôè,21
20442,dude im so slow it been 1 month i didnt touch roblox,52
20443,that would get luastate -> global yes?,38
20444,getshittystate(scriptcontext + something),41
20445,did i need to like,18
20446,ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh nooooooooooooooooooo,36
20447,does it need shit,17
20448,i somehow crash on calling the,30
20449,its probably,12
20450,let me check wait,17
20451,in luastate it would be global rn,33
20452,cus in userdata its capability,30
20453,do you mean in userdata?,24
20454,I'm üö´,5
20455,dont od that again bro,22

20464,im pretty sure you didnt,24
20465,who did it,10
20466,yea actually,12
20467,was it about jews,17
20468,what the hell,13
20469,wtf is 0x48 in luastate,23
20470,i dont know the wording for it nobrain,38
20471,what does a hardware command look like in asm like if i want a black pixel on a certain cord how do you call the computer to make that graphical change,151
20472,i was joking but cool,21
20473,sorry bro u are already blocked before u block me,49
20474,i just found decryptluastate in loadstring üíÄ,44

20481,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,19
20482,WRONG,5
20483,YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY,24
20484,correct!,8
20485,that are inside of a shuffle,28
20486,unless you find a way to make ur code recognize all type of members,67
20487,really,6
20488,not reall,9
20489,and just make some shit to find order,37
20490,"dump all offsets like luastate, protos etc",42
20491,cant i just,11
20492,you just need to make an dumper once,36
20493,shuffles aint hard to get,25
20494,so im forced to use shuffles,28
20495,im pretty sure most of debug library uses protos,48
20496,if we want to use functions from luau source we need shuffles,61
20497,I dont use sandboxthread,24
20498,you said no to what,19
20499,chat do we need shuffles for getgenv implementation ü§ì,53
20500,immigrant_thread = lua_newthread(mainthread);\nluaL_sandboxthread(immigrant_thread);,84
20501,usinggggggggggg?,16
20502,ur supposed to make a new thread,32
20503,but ur not supposed to,22
20504,"i mean, we can use mainthread as luastate if i had to guess",59
20505,then luavmload and taskdefer wont owrk,38
20506,revolutionary tech.,19
20507,been 1 month i didnt touch roblox,33
20508,what if I just don't decrypt the lua state,42
20509,i forgot how to find it tho,27
20510,ok guys hear me out,19
20511,if you decrypt it,17
20512,decryptluastate i know,22
20513,it returns mainthread,21
20514,1. the first func takes an arg\n2. theres a func to decrypt the lua state,73
20515,pov : it spams i hate hard Rs,29
20516,free robux,10

20658,and tell them to hide from cameras and use a sweater,52
20659,kind of useless,15
20660,and so nobody will know,23
20661,and so they only need to plug it in for 5 seconds,49
20662,imagine getting hyperion source code,36
20663,not enough!,11
20664,and tell them its not really harmful,36
20665,or wire transfer,16
20666,and use btc to send payments,28

20820,thx ad for the lua vm load,26
20821,0x40000 is useless,18
20822,i should switch to 0x0,22

20837,you just need all shuffles,26
20838,but you need shuffeles,22
20839,in roblox studio,16
20840,u can still use luau load,25
20841,itll be in luavm load,21
20842,cus luau load is inlined,24
20843,is bytecode mismatch,20
20844,the easiest way to find it,26
20845,on how to find it btw,21
20846,on how to ifnd it,17
20847,and that it has + xx in it,26
20848,you just need to know that its in loadstring,44
20849,i didn't found luavm_load on roblox studio,42
20850,aka compressed bytecode,23
20851,yeah thats irrelevant for us though,35
20852,second,6
20853,"a1, v15 + 16, v13, 0i64",23

20875,or ur lua state,15
20876,unless ur compression is wrong,30
20877,well it doesn't.,16
20878,ye I compress it,16
20879,but you also gotta compress it afterwards,41
20880,you gotta compress with a special key,37
20881,so I don't pass it to compile?,30
20882,that doesnt have to do with compressing,39
20883,thats for op codes,18
20884,this shit,9
20885,rather hash,11
20886,"and I encrypt the bytecode, correct?",36
20887,by saying 1. skibidi rizz to the pc pls call this specific address,66
20888,forgot to add,13
20889,u need to compress it,21
20890,you cant do that,16
20891,"Luavm::load(LuaState, &CompressedBytecode, ""ChunkName"", env); (env = 0)",71
20892,on the arg 2 you need to put the bytecodes Luau::compile,56
20893,dma are for gods,16
20894,internal are for pros,21
20895,externals are for noobs,23
20896,whats ur issue,14
20897,idk I didnt read ur whole conversion,36
20898,of luavm::load,14
20899,with the 2nd argument,21
20900,I don't see how me being internal or external has anything to do,64
20901,I never claimed I was,21
20902,he internal,11
20903,I crash whenever I try to call luavm_load,41
20904,ur not external then,20
20905,I have the lua state,20
20906,I can call functions,20
20907,if you cant call roblox funcs externally how would you call luavm::load lol,75
20908,luavm_load is only for internal,31
20909,still not relevant,18
20910,wow crazy,9
20911,you cant call roblox functions externally yes,45
20912,let me check ma function wait,29
20913,now how is this relevant to load??,34
20914,ok cool,7
20915,not inject and stuff,20

20927,You can use remote threads???,29
20928,only internal,13
20929,you can't call custom fucntion fully on external,48
20930,answer about what i said and i will help you about luvam,56
20931,Why does it matter whether I'm external or internal. I can call functions just fine,83
20932,Specifically for the 2nd arg,28
20933,are u dll or exe,16
20934,What do I pass,14
20935,I'd tell you but I forgot.,26

20943,Current identity is 0.,22
20944,but you draw the line at load?,30
20945,ok so I can call printidentity just fine,40
20946,use corescript.,15
20947,you can't use luavm,19
20948,you external,12
20949,what args do I pass,19
20950,not external.,13
20951,luavm_load can only be called internaly.,40
20952,isn't luvam_load for internal?,30
20953,internal you have full,22
20954,ok crazy,8
20955,cuz internal isn't same as external,35
20956,"Again, why does that matter",27
20957,should work only for internal?,30
20958,how do you even use luavm_load on external,42
20959,"the way I have it set up is\n`luavm_load(state, &bytecode, ""chunkname"", 0)`",75
20960,why does that matter,20
20961,are you external or internal,28
20962,do you even how to use luavm_load?,34

21717,exploit is the dll/injector,27
21718,in my opinion executor is just a wpf app ::),44
21719,"if you would have said 'identity' instead of 'level' and 'executor' instead of 'dll', i may would have helped you",113

21741,Mr. Jealous,11

266,i won't be a nuisance to luau coders üôè,38
267,i don't really have to worry about it,37
268,actually because all i want is executor dll for roblox,54
269,internally its 10000x more different so you're going to have to worry about it yes,82
270,great,5
271,i understand it now,19
272,luau code is not valid lua code,31
273,lua code in backwards compatible with luau,42
274,the second one,14
275,now you are saying lua is luau,30
276,you said luau is lua,20
277,because lua is old and messy every lua is luau,46
278,and i dont have worry about it,30
279,so basically luau is lua,24
280,luau is the successor to lua,28
281,so why does it have the same noun suffix,40
282,you neglecting an entire typechecking system is indicative of your lack of programming skill,92
283,luau is typessfe and faster,27
284,Lua is so old and messy,23
285,luau,4
286,roblox uses Luau,16
287,huh,3

415,mhm,3
416,do that,7

422,a long ago,10
423,when was that added,19

988,plus,4
989,scholarships,12

2183,"just leave the method dead , lol",32
2184,u said that im must be retarded and sended no brain emoji stinky nigger,71
2185,"it is not mine , plus it's just for getting signature, you want to buy one and use signtool?",92
2186,u gave,6
2187,so u have nothing to say about ur sigthief,42
2188,you is think that work? lol,27

2198,without it being valid,22
2199,sig**thief**,12
2200,"its not faked , it's stolen lol",31
2201,because the signature is not valid,34
2202,nothing can help,16
2203,even ur nvidia dll wont help,28
2204,you were trying to use,22
2205,and no brain emoji,18
2206,U said that im must be retarded just because the shit u gave not working for me,79
2207,"i dont own sigthief , lol",25
2208,amazing,7
2209,ballistic module,16
2210,ur signthief signs without validity,35
2211,well nigga,10
2212,it check if valid too,21
2213,first i need u to prove that it only checks for a sig,53
2214,why would you purchase a sig for like 300$ for roblox,53
2215,"buy a legit signature , what?",29
2216,(even shellcode can sometimes crash roblox),43
2217,i tried shellcode but it fucks my brain alot,44
2218,or buy a legit signature,24
2219,i think that to inject we need to stop riding winverifytrust and actually use shellcode,87
2220,so,2
2221,i tried to use a method that makes all sigs verified and roblox doesnt open it jus crashes then,95
2222,yes noob,8
2223,it does,7
2224,^,1
2225,maybe it also checks if the sig is valid?,41
2226,"""it checks if it has a sig""",27
2227,prove it,8
2228,"if u cant do it , just give up",30
2229,"It is real , its just not valid but hyperion checks if it has a sig",67
2230,and look this nigga wont even respond,37
2231,"u also tried to make me feel  (i hope it means something similar to shame) disgraced by sending no brain emoji while saying ""what are u doing""",142
2232,microsoft gives signtool for a reason,37
2233,sigthief is dogshit,19
2234,not knowing how to sign...,26
2235,i guess it only would work if the signature is valid and not fake,65
2236,i crash,7
2237,but it still didnt work nigga,29
2238,cuz it has signature of nvidia corporation,42
2239,is some dll from nvidia right,29
2240,"i cannot tell if u is sarcastic , or u genuinely tried to use",61
2241,dont use  use an nvidia dll,27

2247,nobrain,7
2248,why are you using,17
2249,then you is must be retarded,28

2267,on how to use,13
2268,is there a tutorial,19
2269,you just sign ur dll with correct arguments and then setwindowshookex to inject ur dll,86

2282,do I steal signature from,25
2283,what fucking dll,16
2284,mashallah,9
2285,I can just skid this and I have a working injector?,51
2286,yes u can do swhx in C but i recommend  for the certification as making ur own will seem pretty hard,100
2287,swhx,4
2288,"which method, mmap or swhx?",27
2289,c,1
2290,which one,9
2291,uhr would that be possible in c,31
2292,"i suggesting manual map but if you want to do the easy way than you can just sign ur dll without using wvt , prob sigthief and then setwindowshookex",148
2293,so what's another way to inject,31
2294,since like 3 week ago... im not sureing if they mapped it with some flag like SEC_NO_CHANGE but changing the page protection so you can do writing on it wont work anymore.,171
2295,since when was it patched üòî,27
2296,you cant... if you write to wintrust page you will see that nothing happens,75
2297,you can I'm pretty sure,23
2298,"The bytes wont matter , as you cannot write to wintrust page any more",69
2299,pass them to me too baby,24
2300,send me working bytes for wintrust,34
2301,then winverifytrust,19
2302,noob tell david bazuki to sign ur dll,37

2589,"no, if it crashes after a longer period of time thats not from the shellcode",76

2592,i dont think that will ever happen,34
2593,"otherwise, u COULD crash if it changes permissions in that time",63
2594,if it it works it works,23
2595,well then your shellcode needs to be whitelisted ofc,52
2596,and write there,15
2597,i just allocate some memory,27

2877,guys it works!,14
2878,gonna switch  to my dll rq and rename it,40
2879,just sit aorund and wait until skids figure out they can pseudo-sign their DLLs,79
2880,ye i still dont get SHt so uh,29
2881,haha,4
2882,the other half won't know how to update it,42

2887,it sucks,8
2888,ignore the auto typing,22
2889,what the fuck is this,21
2890,woah now set_insert last argument for me is a char pointer,58
2891,let me check assembly,21
2892,does ida?,9
2893,because the pseudocode sucks,28
2894,why the reset not take pointer,30
2895,take note,9
2896,alright,7

2905,i do that?,10
2906,give me a sec,13
2907,obviously you'd know,20
2908,pages = correct btw,19
2909,can we move to dms or ??,24
2910,"or maybe it is, but not the correct templated one",49
2911,that is not set::insert,23
2912,where the fuck are you looking,30
2913,thats good to know,18
2914,this confuser,13
2915,wait am i using wrong registers??,33
2916,what is that 0x40,17
2917,read the pseudocode and look at how byfron calls it,51
2918,how am i calling it wornggg,27
2919,because you're calling it wrong,31
2920,but also doesnt crash,21
2921,i cant understand why it doesnt work,36

2930,is that any true,16
2931,i heard u have a hyperion emulator,34
2932,I'm pretty sure you can do shit like shellcode reflective injection,67
2933,you can mmap,12
2934,thread pool and mmap,20
2935,need to do,10
2936,dont you,8
2937,ill experiemnt,14
2938,ooh,3
2939,the value doesn't matter but it needs to be valid,49
2940,you need a valid ptr for the 2nd argument,41
2941,thread hijacking,16
2942,poolparty?,10
2943,depends on how you spawn it,27
2944,okay well why doesnt my code work?,34
2945,¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø,9
2946,it doesn't matter,17
2947,pleas,5
2948,say that in assembly,20
2949,reduces the size,16
2950,you could just pass a ptr to data instead of passing multiple pointers,70
2951,whats wong,10
2952,with actual,11
2953,i replace it,12
2954,yeah?,5

2978,u know what else is massiveüòà,28
2979,dude it is still massive,24
2980,meme,4
2981,it's that that low taper fade like,34
2982,you know what else is crazy?,28
2983,indeed,6
2984,that's crazy,12
2985,what so hard to understand,26
2986,this commit just so happens to also add a seperate script for offsets,69
2987,one whole commit,16
2988,ethan legit,11
2989,whatever helps you sleep at night tho,37
2990,"so either he wrote 2 fully random UNC functions and never gave you any code after that, or your code contains a lot from ballistic",130
2991,And it jus tso coincidentally happens that you used his naming for two completely unrelated functions,101
2992,Why rewrite something he already has written that works,55
2993,"Because Ethan already wrote like 90% UNC, so I assume any parts that he wrote for your project were probably copy-pasted from his old code",138
2994,the fact that you can even recognise the style tells me that you skid ballistic often,85
2995,do you have the ability to think,32
2996,that 50% of the exec was written by ethan,41
2997,automatically assumed,21
2998,and you just,12
2999,i showed you one fucking comment,32
3000,"""half""",6
3001,forget a 0?,11
3002,5% yet somehow half the function names are the exact same as he called them in ballistic,88
3003,When velocity was sonar,23
3004,Back in the ancient days,24
3005,He only did a few unc funcs,27
3006,5%,2
3007,Ethan's code is like,20
3008,Will educate myself more next time,34
3009,I'm **sorry** I don't know who's on the dev team for your shitsploits,69
3010,also,4
3011,"so, by extension, velocity sucks as well",40
3012,"Ballistic was a piece of shit, and always will be a piece of shit",65
3013,"awesome, code debt",18
3014,im new to roblox's like functioning and stuff,45
3015,i have proper offsets and stuff what method should i use to access and read/write memory? im using cpp,102
3016,just a dogshit esp,18
3017,would it be hard to code an external esp in C,45
3018,Interesting,11
3019,its already,11
3020,is it true asshurt is coming back with 100% unc,47
3021,85%,3
3022,Ethan authored most of ballistic,32
3023,jjsploit best api,17
3024,shut up bro,11
3025,"velocity is worked on by me, **Ethan** and CG",45
3026,ignorance = retard behaviour,28

3031,weirdest shit I've seen,23
3032,no it's like a function call,28
3033,get bytecode + 0x10,19
3034,Because apparently reading from an offset is too difficult,58
3035,Ethan used it to get bytecode,29
3036,request_code unknown for me,27
3037,straight from ballistic source code,35
3038,"I was looking at `request_code`, `KTable`, and `GetProperty`",60
3039,nigga really call it lua_pushinstance,37
3040,it's like announcing you skidded ballistic,42
3041,also what are those variable names,34
3042,an AOB scanner is like 20 loc,29

3732,what a coinncidence!,20
3733,just watched that actually,26
3734,and then the attacker can just check which servers have that image using its ID,79
3735,and then your device tries to get that image\nwhich results in cloudflare caching it at the closest server to you,113
3736,by sending an image,19
3737,which locates you using cloudflare cache servers,48
3738,smb just made a new doxxing tool for discord,44

3745,GetGlobalStateForInstance,25
3747,Get Global State,16
3748,It's not,8
3749,but why LuaStateGetter,22
3750,bro I know it's getglobalstate,30
3751,i thought u were sigma,22
3752,bro doesnt know what LuaStateGetter is üíî skid üíî,47
3753,How would a fortnite fly cheat work *I won't even make a fortnite cheat as its hard* just curious,97

3757,wtf is LuaStateGetter,21
3758,????????,8
3759,wow hacker,10
3760,im just experimenting,21
3761,Idk bruv its been 4 years,25
3762,ok ?,4
3763,its gonna bring me love,23
3764,what is the damn global state gonna bring you üò≠,47
3765,nice,4
3766,Well i actually got globalstate only thing left todo is decrypt it,66
3767,i was just throwing the information out there,45
3768,"what does it bring you if it works, but it's not efficient",58
3769,but it works,12
3770,never said its ideal,20
3771,it works,8
3772,for the thread_node,19
3773,the threadlist,14
3774,but then i need to access,25
3775,AAAA,4
3776,same way u do it internally,27
3777,thats how it goes for me usually,32
3778,etc,3
3779,loop through sizep,18
3780,otherwise ur capabilities would not be set,42
3781,ye iknow,8
3782,raise proto,11
3783,yeah because you also need to set proto capability,50
3784,i use c++,9
3785,do you use python,17
3786,insane,6
3787,for setting identities,22
3788,100 lines,9
3789,"you can write shellcode that sets ur identity, capability and gets you the lua state and itll still be less than 100 lines",122
3790,so it kinda is for me atm,25
3791,It's been 4 years since i last touched c++,42
3792,its not that difficult,22
3793,use shellcode,13
3794,internal addy's won't do much,29
3795,[+] GetTaskScheduler found at address: 0x2DC1D50\n[+] GetGlobalStateForInstance found at address: 0xD6DC20\n[+] DecryptLuaState found at address: 0xB46EB0,154
3796,im external üíÄ,13
3797,.,1
3798,coroutine.running(),19
3799,just use shellcode dont bother üôè,32
3800,i hate them,11
3801,I swear those identities,24
3802,very original,13
3803,man mapper,10
3804,or you can write a manmapper and go internal,44
3805,if u have a reliable shellcode injector you can throw all that shit in the garbage and just go Hybrid,101
3806,yea raw schedulrt,17
3807,requires shellcode,18
3808,Or job_name,11
3809,so basically i need to get a thing to get a thing to get a thing to get datamodel,81
3810,or getscheduler,15
3811,you also need JobStart and JobEnd,33
3812,and to get taskscheduler you can use RawTaskScheduler,53
3813,to get the render job you first need task scheduler aswell,58
3814,Most obvious being renderjob + 0x218,36
3815,and there are many ways to get that aswell,42
3816,but u need RenderView still,27
3817,update the offsets,18
3819,and so on,9
3820,u can get it thru renderview + offset,37
3821,u can get it thru script ctx + offset,37
3822,there are many ways,19
3823,then look for the datamodel stuff,33
3824,then learn how to use ida,25
3825,check out the roblox 2016 leaked src to understand where datamodel is located first,83
3826,Don' u still need scriptcontext though,38
3827,"anyway, how would i update the external way to get datamodel and the addresses for xeno since idk really how to do that never rllyu worked with xeno",148
3828,y'all didnt reverse or sum ?,28
3829,Huh im not aware of this,24
3830,"you use ""this""",14
3831,if you have a variable in said class that you want to access \nfrom inside of a function in that class,102
3832,grab the state using script thread node,39
3833,"""this"" is a pointer that refers to the current instance of the class within a member function.",94
3834,What do u wanna do then? setting identity and capabilities in extra space\nand capabilities in proto?,101
3835,"in xeno why do they name things like ""this"" name children and that like wtf is ""this""",85
3836,no?,3
3837,and i'm too lazy to open ida,28

4995,wouldnt be too bad,18
4996,one question sir,16
4997,i might revamp 0vaxes intergity check bypass,44
4998,hm,2
4999,atrexus*,8
5000,wvt still works u js gotta remap but then u get fucked by integrity check/rwx scanner,85
5001,so u dont wanna do bypassers and injectors and no executor,58
5002,all ive been doing was talking to atrezx,40
5003,i havent checked since months,29
5004,no idea lmfao,13
5005,anyways hmmm,12

5007,i mean something really useful,30
5008,the others dont care,20
5009,"maybe 0,2% of the community will use mine",41
5010,theres litterally no need for me to open source a injector when everyones going to use some bs manual map or winverify trust,124
5011,why wont u do injectors,23
5012,also i got a question,21
5013,also didnt the constant sig change i dont think this works vro,62
5014,so luau-load works?,19
5015,not bad tbh,11

5031,free?,5
5032,which works,11

5035,ask the owner of sypnase z,26
5036,i kinda need one,16

5038,everywhere,10
5039,thewre are tutorials on it,26

5051,there are already public ones,29
5052,idk how hard it is,18
5053,why not get a decryptor,23

5056,of stuff,8
5057,wdyn,4

5060,but i have no idea what,23
5061,i have to release something hyperion related,44
5062,someone give me fucking ideas,29
5063,944 lines of  file üò≠,20

5069,musst net genau sagen,21
5070,kannst du in dm sagen ich frag mich wirklich wieso ads so ist,61
5071,eh alr,6
5072,es ist zu dumm um geleaked zu sein,34
5073,ich kanns dir einfach nicht sagen,33
5074,^^,2
5075,und durch zufall etwas entdeckt,31
5076,deswegen hab ich mich dran gesetzt,34
5077,ja,2
5078,also manche,11
5079,ja aber die k√∂nnen ja eif pure wintrust usen ohne bypass,56
5080,"wenn ich den ""bypass"" nicht nutze geht es n√§hmlich nicht",56
5081,naja ich bin mir ja nicht 100% sicher aber ich habe durch zufall etwas entdeckt dann hab ich √ºberlegt wie ich es umgehe und es gibt also denke ich mal das war es,161
5082,wieso ist das so üò≠,18
5083,i found out why it works for some people and for some it doesnt,63
5084,so you might be in a different channel.,39
5085,I don't use bloxstrap,21
5086,You might be in a different channel,35
5087,how not on latest hyp,21
5088,to the latest,13
5089,But i updated it,16
5090,SetWindowHookEx,15
5091,What do you mean SWHX?,22
5092,"if so, youre not on the latest hyp version",42
5093,does it use SWHX with winverf patch?,36
5094,so yeah rbx_print,17
5095,I just wanted to test if ballistic is patched,45
5096,injection isnt hard,19
5097,"rbx_print, wow.",15
5098,crashes,7
5099,it always,9
5100,when opening cheat engine,25
5101,i tested that,13
5102,i wana see if it crashes,24
5103,can u open cheat engine or smth?,32
5104,i don't want to wake it up tho,30
5105,hyp  aint sleeping for me,25
5106,its gay,7
5107,ugh,3
5108,it is sleeping for me tho ü§ë,27
5109,maybe hyp  is sleeping for some people,38
5110,this makes absolutely no sense,30
5111,its js for some people my friends also can use wintrust without any problems but for me it js doesnt work,105
5112,Let's go skids going to use it again!!!,39
5113,dawg wtf,8
5114,And no i didn't downgrade,25
5115,Skids are going to use ballistic again üíÄ,40
5116,Is it enough proof?,19
5117,let me screenshot it,20
5118,screenshot?,11
5119,How should i proof it to you?,29
5120,I just tested simple print code and it worked with ballistics,61
5121,i thought it was patched after hyp,34
5122,why the ballistic's injector still working?,43
5123,and a game,10
5124,I might just try on assault cube as thats common,48
5125,alright nice,12
5126,So I can safely edit?,21
5127,most things u do in usermode wont affect the system,51
5128,thats good,10
5129,virtual memory is temporary,27
5130,Is it safe to do this with like notepad cuz the notepad is in system or am I wrong,82
5131,ooh that should work,20
5132,msdn is your friend,19
5133,I'll send a vid in dm,21
5134,I just don‚Äôt have code explaining it ü§∑,38
5135,Yes I get that,14
5136,Writes memory,13
5137,Memory write,12
5138,Reads memory,12
5139,Memory read,11
5140,Basically,9
5141,Btw all the videos I see of memory read and write are hid behind a paywall or so crappy video. Do u got docs of it or something,127

5145,SEC_NO_CHANGE disables ghe ability to change the protection of a view,69
5146,is SEC_NO_CHANGE like the mseal proposal in linux?,50
5147,nigga just dont fucking create exploit just buy exploit üòé,57
5148,okay u could map a new view,27
5149,I can tell you in dms,21
5150,you clearly havent looked into it,33
5151,its mapped with SEC_NO_CHANGE,29
5152,That doesnt matter,18
5153,u cant change the protections,29
5154,You dont,8
5155,Very useful actually,20
5156,ull have to remap it,20
5157,I will,6
5158,share the word,14
5159,fuck tobias in ass,18
5160,"i mean, you wont be patching anything in the .text section either way",69
5161,but the job got removed,23
5162,The integrity check used to be a job,36
5163,my bad,6
5164,oops youre right,16
5165,and other one checks every idk,30
5166,and in this i dissasemble then copy string literal,50
5167,one checks every 8s,19
5168,theres actually 2 that crash you,32
5169,Theres one that crashes you,27
5170,they have multiple integrity checks,35
5171,I js told you,13
5172,hyperion implements the checks for the exe aswell,49
5173,It isnt,7
5174,it is for the exe,17
5175,They have multiple integrity checks,35
5176,not .exe,8
5177,thats for,9
5178,lol wat,7
5179,not roblox,10
5180,integrity bypass,16
5181,"""hyperion""",10
5182,can u read?,11
5183,direct insert,13
5184,which variant do i pick for poolparty,37
5185,there arent any,15
5186,mu AVX0,7
5187,idk if it was vmp,17
5188,vmp?,4
5189,arent there open source ones?,29
5190,the one on the roblox module scans the .text and some other section,67
5191,section*,8
5192,.text page,10
5193,integrity check of what,23
5194,I dont think it calls any um callbacks besides the ic one,57
5195,either one,10
5196,or for a integrity check bypass,31
5197,Ive been looking for a bypass for quite a while,47
5198,I got 0 clue,12
5199,as i couldnt see how id detect it,33
5200,how exactly does the detection work,35
5201,Maybe a violation too,21
5202,js crashes u,12
5203,silent?,7
5204,detected in which way,21
5205,oh wow,6
5206,i generated some assembly code with .asm file instead like wtf,62
5207,omfg nigga how to compile shellcode,35
5208,for it to not crash you,23
5209,You'd need a bypass,19
5210,SetThreadContext has always been detected,41
5211,oK I could maybe use it I d got experience with it,50
5212,imgui is good,13
5213,I‚Äôve used imgui is that good,28
5214,CLI meaning command line interface,34
5215,go for a cli tool,17
5216,Yes I‚Äôll stick to console prolly then,37
5217,"Well GUIs can be made using Cpp, but thats a whole different hell you shouldnt get into at the beginning",104
5218,.net gui and that,17
5219,It would still work with console though since gui is mainly c# no?,66
5220,as u need to interact with all sorts of stuff,45
5221,Nice I might do that,20
5222,thats a good project,20
5223,Oh totally,10
5224,Could like password manager fit into that,41
5225,Hmm,3
5226,"Something you do alot, automate it",34
5227,No idea lol,11
5228,Like,4
5229,But like I don‚Äôt have any ideas on what to do,45
5230,I recommend just writing tooling for everyday tasks,51
5231,I guess,7
5232,its a slow transition,21
5233,you should stop thinking about a concrete barrier between simple and advanced,77
5234,Alright,7
5235,"yep it is, just checked",23
5236,But a little,12
5237,Like not into the fully advanced,32
5238,So what should I do for a smaller advanced project,50
5239,Could be,8
5240,atleast its syntax,18
5241,but i believe C sharp was based off of cpp,42
5242,ofcourse theyre not the same,28
5243,Overall similar but not the same,32
5244,And that,8
5245,Includes,8
5246,Like the,8
5247,Isn‚Äôt,5
5248,It is t,7
5249,For some things,15
5250,If I‚Äôm pretty sure the functions calling are different too,58
5251,syntax is quite similar tho,27
5252,Why I said as well,18
5253,totally different behaviour under the hood,42
5254,not just that,13
5255,As well,7
5256,Yeah different syntax,21
5257,"one is native, the other is managed",35
5258,Dang,4
5259,C# and cpp are polar opposites,30
5260,Oh ok,5
5261,it does not,11
5262,C# as well if that counts,25
5263,Maybe a 2-3 week,16
5264,how long have u been coding in c or cpp,39
5265,Honestly I understand it most of the time,41
5266,I am quite familiar with it,27
5267,and not jumping into a big and complicated project,50
5268,i recommend getting familiar and close with the language,56
5269,theyre a core concept of c,26
5270,What should I do after,22
5271,After I‚Äôve finished it off,26
5272,"Oh,",3
5273,never used it,13
5274,"hmm, dont know",14
5275,when someone try its crash already,34
5276,"I dont know, i dont see how theyd patch it tbh",46
5277,Isnt this already patched?,26
5278,knew it,7
5279,Thread pool lol,15
5280,pointers are the basics,23
5281,Now I‚Äôm onto more advanced I could say,38
5282,That‚Äôs all,10
5283,I‚Äôm just at pointers now,24
5284,I learned std crap with all mathematic stuff alongside making calculation and that,82
5285,Actually,8
5286,I did,5
5287,its gonna make your life much easier,36
5288,i recommend learning C basics before trying anything advanced,61
5289,yes yes,7
5290,I knew I was correct somehow,28
5291,Thanks 4 sayin üòÉ,16
5292,spelling is hard,16
5293,API (application programming interface) is just a interface between two programms,81
5294,"false, API is a valid term for dlls aswell",42
5295,or thread ctx setting,21
5296,threadpool abuse?,17
5297,"its not odd, it abuses threadPOOLS",34
5298,i recommend listening to the talk about it,42
5299,fairly decent aswell,20
5300,it is very interesting,22
5301,can someone give shellcode with messagebox,42
5302,This what i wonder how its didnt got patched,44
5303,well i hasnt worked on this,27
5304,no mem whitelist,16
5305,but ass,7
5306,its shell code msg simple lol?,30
5307,variant 7,9
5308,the method I sent u,19
5309,Ive been using that for ages,28
5310,You used it before?,19
5311,It seems good,13
5312,I‚Äôm gonna search about that pool party one,42
5313,Oh that‚Äôs good to know,22
5314,and it makes no difference,26
5315,Because usermode is way easier,30
5316,How come?,9
5317,Useless,7
5318,And how difficult are they,26
5319,Do kernel injectors work I heard of those as well,49
5320,The one by safe breach labs?,28
5321,Nice,4
5322,on the new client,17
5323,That still works,16
5324,Variant ID 7,12
5325,Odd name choice,15
5326,Huh,3
5327,github PoolParty,16
5328,Or docs ig,10
5329,Yo do u know any vids to get me started on DLL injection and that so I can make my own,86
5330,know,4
5331,Makes sense,11
5332,already kniw,12
5333,only smarts,11
5334,I everyone already know,23
5335,But then how does,17
5336,Alr alr,7
5337,not going to leak,17
5338,What thing does it use,22
5339,Idc if detected as long as it‚Äôs an injector,43
5340,What‚Äôs it?,10
5341,its also detected ofc,21
5342,everyone know this method,25
5343,this method hasn't patched yet,30
5344,No shit nigga,13
5345,Who likes femboys,17
5346,I pray for you,14
5347,Bros gonna get ratted,21
5348,what a rookie,13
5349,anyway afk,10
5350,thats why the size,18
5351,and it was also debug mode,26
5352,its developer mode,18
5353,dont run that,13
5354,but here,8
5355,and the delete is not yet implimented,37
5356,dont test out the edit function,31
5357,wanna test it out?,18
5358,been 9 hours but ight,21
5359,ok i finished,13
5360,such as 0xF4853D for example,28
5361,so it works the same for moving addresses and that from a function to the main thing?,85
5362,You always have to deal with pointers especially in a Module,60
5363,but continue?,13
5364,might've mixed it up,20
5365,That's a term used for backend development,42
5366,that then,9
5367,Not an 'api',12
5368,You are referring to a Dynamic Link Library,43
5369,like the dll whom gets injected into the proces,47
5370,the main thing that gets injected,33
5371,like what i mean is,19
5372,I'm thinking of getting onto like dll injectors or such,55
5373,"What are you referring to by ""api""",34
5374,like more common,16
5375,like api and that?,18
5376,a dll injector or,17
5377,so like would u more likely use it in,37
5378,oh im starting to get it,24
5379,like change it but still original not a copy,44
5380,then it will stay the same for original?,40
5381,if i change it inside a function,32
5382,pointer*,8
5383,so for like pointe,18
5384,ohhh,4
5386,which a normal variable cant do,31
5387,but idk the use cases,21
5388,and that,8
5389,ye ik how to define a pointer,29
5390,ez guys,7
5391,byfron bypassed,15
5392,```int a = 1;\nint* b = &a;```,30
5393,but why couldnt a normal variable do that too?,46
5394,fair,4
5395,that's one use case,19
5396,for example for sharing data across functions,45
5397,variables I get that but like the pointers im stuck on,54
5398,such as for what? I'm learning c++ and cant wrap my head around why I'd need to use it and how,94
5399,And Pointers,12
5400,You Always need Variables,25
5401,for example,11
5402,and define int x = 4 before that,32
5403,like int * pX = &x,18
5404,yo do u need pointers for developing like dll injectors or dlls,63
5405,Networking changed a little,27
5406,dang,4
5407,Finally Updated My Hyperion Emulator for Hyp,44
5408,does anybodygot solara official link? for discrod,49
5409,or som,6
5410,is bro removing the rat,23
5411,so wait like 1 day or sth,25
5412,nevermind im adding a feature and this will take forever,56
5413,"Sure, just remember to send the one without the rat",51
5414,guaranteed not rat!,19
5415,anyone wanna test out my password manager so far?,49
5416,I didn't mean unique identifier as a string\nI meant it literally\nA literal unique identifier\nSomething about the executor that makes it different,148
5417,Scirip,6
5418,"Not how it works lol, they only ban for specific flags that you trip on I'm so sure of it you don't handle detections from YARA",127
5419,I might be tripping but aren't you that dude from Hydrogen?,59
5420,Yo dude,7
5421,"in the loader, look for HYPV",28
5422,u can just check,16
5423,looooooool,10
5424,does version-ecc9c250281b4c14 have,34
5425,remove nuclear pedophile immediately.,37
5426,skid decrypter is coming soon,29
5427,try releasing a job,19
5428,guys xspy is releasing,22
5429,LOVE RUST; LOVE RUST,20
5430,Well near undetected,20
5431,nothing undetected,18
5432,I‚Äôm just asking if it‚Äôs undetected,34
5433,ok and,6
5434,Manual map,10
5435,just make one,13
5436,Yall does mapping injector thingy work for Roblox cuz winverufy patches in,74
5437,also i just going to use uniqe dump,35
5438,decrypt ass,11
5439,just decrypt page,17
5440,for dumping boblox,18
5441,what about decryptor,20
5442,pretty sure its going leak anyways,34
5443,i already have method,21
5444,"Ur patched, skid",16
5445,i do like wait 3 seconds before initalizing,43
5446,gameloaded and gameended inlined but  you can make smth like them,65
5447,i gonna implement teleport handler using shitty method since i dont have enough time cuz roblox gonna update soon,113
5448,Oh no. A black monkey!!,23
5449,yes Love it,11
5450,decraptor,9
5451,Auto correction going crazy,27
5452,is my pattern dumper already obsolete,37
5453,No more gogo1000 decraptor ü§∑,28
5454,If you didn't know,18
5455,Page Encryption changed,23
5456,rust ftw,8
5457,Then i would have a reason to Recreate Page Whitelist,53
5458,all the ballistic pasters are about to get nuked üó£Ô∏è,51
5459,Would have been more fun,24
5460,I wish they would have patched my Injector,42
5461,no more pasted shitsploits,26
5462,Hyperion  has been enrolled.,28
5463,Yeah.,5
5464,with rustc and gcc,18
5465,What Version,12
5466,with encs and shuffles,22
5467,i couldnt get luau to compile,29
5468,specifically,12
5469,is it true that patching winverifytrust no longer works on latest roblox,72
5470,i made my exec in rust\nthen i figured out that using c++ libs in rust is a pain in the ass\nthen i made it in c++,114
5471,skul skul skul,14
5472,c++ wrapper ahh mindset,23
5473,fyi,3
5474,everything fixes itself,23
5475,ahh mindset,11
5476,if it doesnt work the compiler will fix it,42
5477,I agree,7
5478,"I hate rust programmers, sorry",30
5479,they all share the same braincell,33
5480,thinking,8
5481,and rust programmer,19
5482,common sense,12
5483,i have,6
5484,Rust Programmer Mentality,25
5485,and go UD,9
5486,then i'd know they switched to global,37
5487,no biggie,9
5488,1 day,5
5489,for,3
5490,i'd get banned,14
5491,do you have an insider !?,25
5492,and even if they did,20
5493,they wont,9
5494,Gotta Update my Hyperion Emulator,33
5495,they can switch to global waves overnight,41
5496,ive yet to get banned on my alt that i crashed roblox 594326598342 times on,75
5497,Shit,4
5498,i wont get banned,17
5499,even if im detected,19
5500,theyre always targeted,22
5501,as long as your executor doesnt have some unique identifier u shouldnt get banned\nbecause banwaves are targeted,112
5502,"It's not that as hard as it seems, most of y'all are just incompetent developers.",81
5503,just be detected,16
5504,then try to be undetected,25
5505,but some stuff is not usable,28
5506,its still the same shit,23
5507,none of yall understand that exploiting hasnt even changed the slightest bit,76
5508,Skids won't understand that,27
5509,you maybe,9
5510,We didn't,9
5511,false,5
5512,we left jobs in 2021,20
5513,bro can't accept the fact ..,28
5514,TaskScheduler + 0x50 (trust),28
5515,0x5B67D98,9
5516,Bad Method,10
5517,there is literally a pointer that points directly to the active datamodel,73
5518,"It is, TaskScheduler is the most reliable way to get the datamodel or the Script Context",88
5519,if you do it in a tphandler you will crash eventually,53
5520,it's not,8
5521,no one will answer here,23
5522,"It's a good way to get the datamodel, so why wouldn't he ?",58
5523,i swear some people are gatekeeping,35
5524,and ask there,13
5525,on v3rm,7
5526,you should be more active,25
5527,but idk how,11
5528,i just want datamodel and want any way to get it,48
5529,why are you using jobs for getting datamodel anyway,51
5530,broo,4
5531,i cant get past the simple printsploit bru üò¢,44
5532,task scheduler to datamodel,27
5533,do u atleast have any actual videos who show how the task scheduler to datamodel or pdf,87
5534,Might be a change tho,21
5535,I did not crash,15
5536,I had ida pro while roblox opened,33
5537,Pretty sure they broke their process detection,46
5538,This version might not get pushed I believe,43
5539,mb,2
5540,alr i meant explain,19
5541,I aint feeding,14
5542,"ykw, just explain the scheduler one its fine same thing anyways",63
5543,A new method will eventually be leaked again maybe ?,52
5544,Your Code is Just ass,21
5545,Its Not Not working because of the DataModel Method,51
5546,yo bro,6
5547,Finally,7
5548,Was talking to the pasters xD,29
5549,I got my own injextor üôÇ,23
5550,Correct,7
5551,And winverifytrust?,19
5552,Maybe i'll leak my efi injector for y'all,41
5553,Swhx patched?,13
5554,"Actually after longer reversal, it's",36
5555,Real????,8
5556,"New Update enrolled hyperion , finally the pasters are gone. Awesome day",72
5557,so pretty sure that dont work,29
5558,when the datamodel gets called using scriptcontext,50
5559,when i used it in like,22
5560,it gave me wrong datamodel cuz,30
5561,"yea okay then please shut the fuck up and stop saying that im ""spreading bullshit"" ty!",86
5562,I don't rely on shit methods.,29
5563,idk why it doesnt show for ya,29
5564,did you try runtime already?,28
5565,ah yes,6
5566,0x108 spreading bullshit as always,34
5567,......,6
5568,maybe learn memory safety,25
5569,ill remove it next commit,25
5570,this is so useless actually,27
5571,i'd need an seh,15
5572,mangle the shit out of them,27
5573,if i,4
5574,why would i need SEH on rbx funcs ???,37
5575,you dont know what's inside my lambda,37
5576,i didnt mention everything,26
5577,"lambdas are straight forward, what?",35
5578,"so youd consider those people as non programmers, even if they have lets say 8 years of experience",98
5579,"also theres people who cant just major in CS, or work in a CS related company due to them not being available",109
5580,"its a tradeoff, not a risk",26
5581,borrow checker is my daddy,26
5582,why risk it,11
5583,man,3
5584,correct cpp code shouldnt crash,31
5585,and then i eventually liked it a lot,36
5586,i had to use rust by company policy,35
5587,you cant use c or c++,21
5588,that never crashes,18
5589,and when you need ultra fast software,37
5590,i used to work as a backend dev and sysadmin for a hosting company,66
5591,"if u start with rust, its gonna be easier to adapt",50
5592,the reasoning is,16
5593,then c and c++,14
5594,i started with c# and python and then immediately went to rust,62
5595,i come from rust,16
5596,when coming from c based langs,30
5597,called,6
5598,bro's gonna sy syntax,21
5599,but its syntax is just weird,28
5600,"it has some great stuff, especially its macro system",52
5601,reasoning?,10
5602,rust is horrid imo,18
5603,well your definition is just false,34
5604,foss developers rn:,19
5605,"""by my definitions"" üò≠ üôè",23
5606,thats just false lol,20
5607,windows 11 is NOT 40% rust,26
5608,doubt it,8
5609,if youre a hobbyist youre not a real programmer by my definitions,65
5610,im saying real programmer as in someone that has a degree and works at a company (or owns a company),100
5611,so ur calling me a fake programmer ?,36
5612,windows 11 is 55 million lines,30
5613,"""i code c++ because its a hacker man language, rust sux""",56
5614,yall skids dont know what a real programming is,47
5615,"dawg, do you really think real programmers hate rust? skule",59
5616,they have written more,22
5617,since then,10
5618,spreading miss information,26
5619,hating rust devs just because of the stereotype goes crazy,58
5620,and c,5
5621,like c++,8
5622,i use rust because it doesnt fucking crash every 2 seconds,58
5623,Windows 11 is 40% Rust\nLinux kernel is now over 60% Rust (mostly drivers),74
5624,üòê,1
5625,rust programmer,15
5626,when a rust programmer codes in c++ holaymolay real,51
5627,part of that is just my code being really good trolley,54
5628,hasnt crashed since last week,29
5629,it doesnt crash,15
5630,not just those,14
5631,i have SEH wraps everywhere,27
5632,catching exceptions in this case bring you nothing,50
5633,lambda ü§ë,8
5634,because it produces mangled code,32
5635,doubles as anti-skid aswell,27
5636,which safely detaches the module,32
5637,forwards it to my crash handler,31
5638,wraps a func and catches all of it's exceptions,47

5705,that sounds like thats bad,26
5706,yes pls feed me,15
5707,that you can paste?,19
5708,do you want me to give you code?,32
5709,so what does datamodeldeleter do?,33
5710,thats what the datamodel is,27
5711,and with realdatamodel,22
5712,FakeDataModel + DataModelDeleterPointerToDataModel2 = RealDataModel,67
5713,DataModelDeleterPointerToDataModel1 is FakeDataModel,52

6420,SunglassesFreddy,16

6422,its pasted,10
6423,i'd argue that,14
6424,(luavm load),12
6425,excludes the most important addy trolley,40
6426,that's a good question homie,28
6427,Why would i paste A ONE LINE FUNCTION,37
6429,and im guessing that rebase func is from some leaked src,56
6430,using a def is objectively better,33
6431,‚ùì,1
6432,it doesn't HAVE to be then most efficient thing,47
6433,We're not in the 80s,20
6434,just use a definiton...,23
6435,function is crazy,17
6437,cuz i do not want to define that for each and every single address,66
6438,"wait im getting worse at c++ how would i put the rebase in a function, i wanna prolly do thjat too",98
6439,I would say that's pretty good,30
6440,the lootlabs so,15
6441,but i just posted,17
6442,total?,6
6443,for now 9,9
6444,Depends how many people visit,29
6445,is  cpm good in lootlabs,24
6446,i slept almost 3 hours today,28
6447,"you just need to add 0x at the beginning, don't mind if the address is smaller",78
6448,I do that? I'm asking if i should do like 0x(add 0 here) on the adresses that are shorter than the rest,103
6449,always put 0x before the address,32
6450,"Two of the adresses are longer than the other two, do i need to add a 0 in front of or after?",93
6451,How can i check if it's the correct one?,40
6452,idk but 2D7B7A0 may be taskscheduler,36
6453,Here is the function def,24
6454,Why do they divide  with it?,28
6455,if i am not mistaken 2D7B7A0 is gettaskscheduler,48
6456,try to find something like  / some address,42
6457,What now?,9
6458,lmao fr it got patched after we talked about it,47
6459,"Rebase with ""image base"", right?",32
6460,"You mean just wait a little, so it can find the xref?",53
6461,just let your ida analyze,25
6462,or  / funciton,14
6463,u will find some function / 1000,32
6464,or just let ida analyze,23
6465,I'll try initialThermalStatus instead,37
6466,"There is no xref for it, that was what the problem was",54
6467,but if you want to use this xerf its fine,41
6468,its easy,8
6469,initialThermalStatus is better,30
6470,rawtaskscheduler,16
6471,"No, i'm searching for `Can't initialize the TaskScheduler before flags have been loaded`",88
6472,are you searching for initialThermalStatus?,43
6473,"Yes, but i renamed it to",24
6474,for robloxplayerbeta,20
6475,gogo's decrypter dumped exe,27
6476,which file are you opening on IDA?,34
6477,"Ok, one more question: Why are there no xrefs on the gettaskscheduler string?",77
6478,organization,12
6479,"Sure, but why?",14
6480,to rebase,9
6481,it would be better if you made an function,42
6482,"Like this, right?",17
6483,i already do that,17
6484,function address + roblox base address,38
6485,Could you give me an example?,29
6486,well you need to make one your own,34
6487,Okay? So what does the rebase function look it,46
6488,13CDA30 is rebase 0x0 on ida,28
6489,lets say my own look like :\n,29
6490,What would that function look like?,35
6491,rebase(0x(adddress that rebased by 0x0),39
6492,"I have rebased, so do i need to do any math on the adress to make it valid in my code? Or can i just add roblox base and it will be good?",137
6493,nvm just wait to someone help you im  bad to explain,52
6494,Heh?,4
6495,and later you build a rebase on c++,35
6496,you need to rebase 0x0,22
6497,"Oh. Anyways, can i just put the function adress right in the code, or do i have to subtract / add something (other than roblox base ofc)",136
6498,hydr?,5
6499,when hydr didn't exist,22
6500,its old,7
6501,you mean 0x400000?,18
6502,or though thay you were joking,30
6503,"sorry, just that i've seen people using 40000000 or something",61
6504,i am using rebase on ida 0x0,28
6505,"Thats a joke, right?",20
6506,0x0,3
6507,What should i set the rebase value as in ida?,45
6508,why dont you use luavm_load for shuffle 4/6/9?,46

7186,when i was in that i was click every keybind and on everypage to find the keyb,78
7187,why u are even viewing it in hex view bro,41
7188,reduce it and make it readable,30
7189,i remember like theres a keybind that will basically,52
7190,ik how to find it,17
7191,try making it urself now,24
7192,i give up on u,14
7193,what keybind is it again to like it will like decrypt the string ror something,78
7194,mbmb aight ill learn then,25
7195,whats the string for local player on ida?,41
7196,thanks man:),12
7197,about walkspeed changer,23
7198,i will go find my project i made 1 year ago literally,53
7200,so i will remember what to do frfr,34
7201,let me copy and paste,21
7202,ty man üôÇ,8
7203,and humanoid + walkspeed offset 2,33
7204,then u do humanoid + walkspeed offset 1,39
7205,then u find humanoid in character,33
7206,then u do local player + character offset,41
7207,then u do players + local player offset if i remember correctly to get local player,83
7208,then make it get players,24
7209,"with name ""Ugc""",15
7210,make ur external shit get datamodel,35
7211,man i couldnt find any good tutorial,36
7212,literally paste antagonist,26
7213,its source lololol,18
7214,whos buying these external aimbot cheats üíÄ,42
7215,dw i wont buy it frfr,21
7216,his selling it,14
7217,its literally showcase of some aimbot shit,42
7218,i found this  this might give me idea on how to create walkspeed changer,72
7219,like those tutorial,19
7220,so i get idea,13
7221,ill learn from youtube,22
7222,meant,5
7223,quit,4

7226,learn nigga learn,17
7227,lke what did u do?,18
7228,anydea?,7
7229,i hav no idea on how to create external frfr,44
7230,yet,3
7231,i didnt try making internal walkspeed changer,45
7232,whats harder to do external  or internal for this,49
7233,first external,14
7234,aight imma try now,18
7235,i wanna internal so i gain experiece frfr,41
7236,u can also make it external,27
7237,man they lied to ma hahahahaha,30
7238,alot easier,11
7239,is it harderthan creating exploit?,34
7240,then write to walkspeed offsets,31
7241,make it get humanoid of ur local player character,49
7242,people told me thats harder,27
7243,like walkspeed changer,22
7244,start with something simple,27
7245,when i first started i already saw u bro,40
7246,the difference between us is experiece,38
7247,i think u should quit,21

7412,his file format is absolute bloated garbage,43
7413,"He said gif, not jif:",21
7414,what even the maker of gif said it,34
7415,Ewwww,5
7416,2nd one,7

7418,nerry vice,10
7419,hello hydrians,14
7420,work smart,10
7421,please dont change next update üôè,32
7422,that change defs in an header file,34
7423,they have an util script,24
7424,he should run sunc test,23
7425,got high,8
7426,if u gonna be external,22
7427,i think u can do only 42% real unc,34
7428,generate a random number at compile time and choose depending on it,67
7429,implement,9
7430,atleast thats how id inplement it,33
7431,"its random, they dont manually change it.",41
7432,it probably just stayed the same by chance,42
7433,bytecode swapping is dumb for internal exploits,47
7434,"you wont get most of it, youre a beginner.",42
7435,stop focusing on unc,20
7436,bytecode swapping is shit,25
7437,no but its better than xeno dont listen to those n words,56
7438,you're better off learning from Xeno / old exploits instead of just copying there source and doing a replace all,112
7439,"I mean, you aren't even changing anything in the source , so it will be considered skidding/renaming",100
7440,but it will be kinda shit,25
7441,if you want to create a exploit without knowing anything,56
7442,use xeno source,15
7443,can i do that also?,19
7444,like arcadia,12
7445,and have even 80 percent real unc,33
7446,can i create a exploit using bytecodeswapping,45
7447,the only thing i know is ballistic,34
7448,what can i look then,20
7449,ooo okay,8
7450,not the print,13
7451,the other addresses,19
7452,i just updated address\nand this fixed,38
7453,then what,9
7454,i just said now no,18
7455,nigga i just now no,19
7456,is ballistic source good?,25
7457,maybe bc u have wrong address lol,33
7458,prob smth running,17
7459,and this fixed,14
7460,i just updated address,22
7461,whats the problem?,18
7462,o okay,6
7463,i already fixed,15

7469,my shuffle dumper is on runtime,31
7470,if roblox decrypter patched,27
7471,its not that hard üíî,19
7472,well but you must to decrypt page and deobfs strings,52
7473,patterns can break,18
7474,xrefs hold 1000x better with the updates,40
7475,yeah buttttttt,14
7476,well i mean this just update 1 pattern,38
7477,i would die if i needed to update patterns for my shuffle dumper,64
7478,its 10x better,14
7479,i thought smth else,19
7480,for scanning,12
7481,??? making ur own xref logic,28
7482,i am not using IDA stuff,24
7483,please get a hold of xrefs,26
7484,he joined like 3 days ago lmao,30
7485,how did rin get a role,22
7486,bro you can use the water cooling of the bios to be in the mainframe of roblox luau execution,93
7487,im learning that,16
7488,mind helpin what thing to actually pattern scan and how i wouldget all points and read them,91
7489,the pesky ?'s,13
7490,like when ur getting signature,30
7491,did u just copy signature with the ? in it or get those filled so it has no question marks in it,96
7492,pattern as in like signature pattern?,37
7493,i already found way how to get the enc global_state 1HEHE,57
7494,my way is to use Pattern + (get the point of all string as SHUFFLE3/5/7/8) read strings,87
7495,the process of it,17
7496,ye but,6
7497,want to do that,15
7498,seeing people,13
7499,i keep,6
7500,i can make dump shuffles,24
7501,good now,8
7502,well the shuffles only changed,30
7503,they keep it the same for like 2-3 updated,42
7504,roblox usually doesnt update unnecessary luau things i imagine,62
7505,but kinda werid that enc global_State didn't changed,52

7516,what a werid verison roblox,27
7517,na,2
7518,they aren't changed,19

7521,the method,10
7522,"I've found some, but i still don't understand the why and what. Like what is  doing, and why do i need a lua state?",115
7523,why am i getting crash with Print,33
7524,"it wont be easy for  a beginner to write a internal executor from scratch, id recommend taking a look at public sources.",120
7525,"to achieve execution, you first need the ability to run luau bytecode under robloxs luau vm (virtual machine)",109
